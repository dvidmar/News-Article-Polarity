1,"Stop Sucking Your Thumbs, Liberals, and Get a Clue

It must be the holidays, because a lot of liberal media types are publishing end-of-year thumbsuckers on democracy. In the Atlantic, Peter Beinart writes that Americans are becoming more liberal; in the New Republic, David Dayen says no, they are not. And over at Vox, Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk show with the World Values Survey that democracy is in trouble as Americans, and people all over the world, are losing faith in it. What’s a conservative to think? Are liberals throwing in the towel, and ready to hand the keys of the kingdom over to conservatives? Hardly. The tone is more about how ungrateful the plebs are, after all liberals have done for them.

Peter Beinart is all excited by the activism of Black Lives Matter and Occupy as markers of a leftward move, as if these regime supporters represented anything other than regime-sponsored activism theater. But Dayen points to the Big Problem: we’ll need more taxes just to deliver on the entitlement promises. And Foa and Mounk report that more and more people across the world are leaning towards the idea of “have the army rule.” So what is really going on? Probably it is nothing more than this: After seven years of the Worst President Ever, even ruling-class liberals sense that something is wrong. Things just ain’t what they used to be. The good old order, in which the voters sensibly voted for liberals that sensibly passed sensible legislation providing health care, pensions, welfare, education, and environmental programs for the people, and everything got better every day in every way… Yes, liberals, what did go wrong? We know what went wrong. Liberals started believing in their own catchphrases about democracy, inequality, and compassion instead of reading, learning, and inwardly digesting the age-old wisdom about humans and government. Now that the wheels are falling off the liberal ruling-class machine after a century without a tune-up, liberals don’t know what to do, because they all took political activism in college instead of learning some political wisdom. If African Americans are taking to the streets, what does that say about half a century of liberal race politics? If we just suffered a huge financial meltdown what does that say about the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC’s financial regulation? If racism and financial instability are still a problem what does that say about the whole philosophy of government by liberals? If current programs can’t be maintained without a tax increase, maybe that’s because the entitlement programs were never anything but bubba bait for the rubes. Maybe the welfare state is not a wondrous creation of rational experts, but a ramshackle slum thrown together by political slumlords rack-renting the workers with unjust payroll taxes. Even a nominal conservative like Ross Douthat mourns the innocence of the liberal consensus. “[I]t’s been hard to imagine the basic liberal democratic capitalist order cracking up”, but now, who knows? Get a clue, liberals. We are in the current mess because of you. Let me count the ways. First of all, there’s the “capitalism is doomed” meme. It wasn’t just rich kids Marx and Engels predicting the immiseration of the workers. In the 1930s the rulers and their tame economists decided that depression would go on forever unless the government primed the pump. In the 1970s the world was ending because of pollution, the energy crisis, and the Limits to Growth. Now we have prophecies of doom unless we stop growth and replace efficient fossil fuels with useless windmills. How many times can you be wrong about capitalism, dudes? Second, we have the liberal faith in politics. Just put the “best men” or the “educated” or the “evolved” in charge and they will administer a compassionate and just society. But this ignores the fact that politics is division; liberals win elections by riling up the bubbas or the brothers. In the century from 1880 to 1980 they did it by stirring up class hatred of the rich. Now they win elections with identity politics, by stirring up race against race, gender against gender, and religion against religion. Gosh, I wonder where that will end up? Third, we have the elite faith in bureaucratic transnationalism, the idea that a global governance is just one more peace process away. In fact, every government in the world was created in war. Do any of you brilliant transnationals think that the creation of your global superstate will be any different? Think about this, liberals. Imagine, if you can, that there is some reincarnation of Bismarck at work right now plotting a series of wars to create a global superstate forging a great coalition of nation states against Islam. Lee Iacocca famously advised Americans to lead, follow, or get out of the way. I think, where liberals are concerned, the only option left now is Option Three.

2,"Donald Trump turned the tables on NBC News’ Savannah Guthrie when she tried to frame Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky as an “alleged” incident.

The “Today” show had the Republican presidential front-runner on live Tuesday to discuss his decision to highlight the sordid past of Hillary Clinton’s husband. It wasn’t long before Guthrie was on the defensive.

The ‘Stop Hillary’ campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: ‘Clinton for prosecution, not president’

“You mention Monica Lewinsky,” Guthrie asked. “Are you saying an alleged extra-marital affair, that of course he has now admitted, is that fair game?”

“Is it alleged? I don’t think that’s alleged,” Trump responded.

“No, he’s admitted it, he’s admitted it,” said Guthrie.

What do YOU think? Why don’t news media understand Donald Trump’s appeal? Sound off in today’s WND poll

“If he’s admitted it, you don’t have to use the word alleged,” said Trump.

“Right, exactly,” the NBC host conceded.

Trump has been under fire since last week by Clinton’s supporters for saying her 2008 campaign was “schlonged” by President Obama.

“She was going to beat Obama. I don’t know who would be worse, I don’t know, how could it be worse? But she was going to beat – she was favored to win – and she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost,” the billionaire said Dec. 21 at an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, WND reported.

See Donald Trump’s exchange with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie:

Trump told Guthrie that attempts by the former secretary of state to portray him as a sexist will be countered by discussions on her husband’s treatment of women.

“You look at whether it’s Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them – that certainly will be fair game. Certainly, if they play the woman’s card with respect to me, that will be fair game.”

Some of the sexual stories and allegations Trump may bring up, besides Bill Clinton’s affair with his former intern, include:

Eileen Wellstone’s claim that Clinton raped her in 1969. The two allegedly met at an Oxford pub.

Juanita Broaddrick’s claim Clinton raped her April 25, 1978.

Gennifer Flowers’ claim that she was Clinton’s mistress for 12 years.

Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide, claimed Clinton sexually assaulted her Nov. 29, 1993.

Paula Jones sued Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994. The lawsuit was dropped in 1998 after an $850,000 out-of-court settlement was reached.

The Democrat front-runner is likely to face increased scrutiny of her husband’s behavior toward women whether her campaign backs off Trump or not. Clinton was already cornered at a New Hampshire campaign event Dec. 3 and asked if women who accused her husband of sexual assault should be believed.

“You recently came out to say that all rape victims should be believed, but would you say that about Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones? Should we believe them as well?” an audience member asked, WND reported.

“Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence,” Clinton replied.

The former secretary of state had previously tweeted Nov. 22, “Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.”",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3yq2hn/trump_schools_news_anchor_for_calling_clintons/,wnd.com
3,"The National Security Agency (NSA) swept up conversations with U.S. lawmakers as it monitored lobbying on the Iran nuclear deal by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his aides.

Netanyahu reportedly remained a top priority for the snooping, according to the report, despite President Obama saying two years ago he would curb eavesdropping on allies.

The Journal also reported that White House officials were worried when they realized the NSA was collecting conversations with lawmakers. It said the administration decided to let the NSA decide what to share.

""We didn't say, 'Do it,'"" a senior U.S. official told the Journal. ""We didn't say, 'Don't do it.'""

The NSA's snooping allegedly found Netanyahu and his aides leaked details of the negotiations gained through Israeli spying, coordinated talking points with Jewish-American groups against the deal and asked those lawmakers who were undecided on the deal how it could get their vote, according to the report.

The administration decided that monitoring Netanyahu served a ""compelling national security purpose,"" according to the Journal, which cited unnamed current and former U.S. officials. Netanyahu spoke out against a potentially unsatisfactory nuclear deal during a speech to a joint session of Congress in March. The U.S. and five other world powers reached a deal with Iran in July. The Israeli leader has previously criticized U.S. spying on Israel, which was revealed in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.

The Obama administration decided against monitoring Merkel and French President François Hollande but continued to monitor Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the report said.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3yqa6g/us_snooping_on_israel_also_caught_talks_with/,thehill.com

A maximum of 3 hours of solitary confinement allowed when a juvenile poses a serious threat to others.

A maximum of 30 minutes of solitary confinement allowed when juvenile poses a serious threat to him- or herself.

Vote Yes if you believe:

Isolation for juveniles can lead to continued criminal or delinquent behavior. #JuvenileDetention

Prolonged solitary confinement can lead to adverse mental consequences. #MentalHealth #JuvenileDetention #SolitaryConfinement

Vote No if you believe:

Solitary confinement is an effective tool for deterring future crimes and behavior. #SolitaryConfinement

The high rates of suicides for juvenile inmates who have been in solitary confinement is not necessarily because of solitary confinement. #SolitaryConfinement #JuvenileDetention #Suicide

Congress.gov link to S 1965

(This is the 1st draft of the summary for a bill in Polinav. Summary & In-Depth is non-partisan & Vote yes/no reasons are fact-checked. if you think something is wrong, should be added or deleted, comment below!)

The concept of solitary confinement, like a “time out” when you’re a kid, isn’t a horrible concept. However, the way it’s used to keep people isolated for days, weeks, months, and even years at a time. That honestly seems like cruel and unusual punishment.

I like that they’re tackling this from the juvenile angle first, since brain development is still fairly crucial at a younger age, so mental trauma is more likely to have a longer lasting effect.

So, yeah, my stance on solitary confinement is that it should be used sparingly, but that assumes an actual functioning prison system. For one, we incarcerate way too many people in the US, with the highest incarcerated population in a developed country (about 700 per 100k). With so many people and not enough officers watching over them, it seems to have become much more of a limited care facility than rehabilitation.

We need to reexamine how our prison system can rehab inmates and help them integrate with society, instead of just keeping them locked up for a period of time. Further, it’s frustrating how much we spend on such an ineffectual system. At the same time, I wouldn’t blame it on just the prison system, but really on how we handle poverty in the US.

I would want my representatives to vote YES on this bill!

5,"While Christianity has been purged from the public schools, the vacuum is being increasingly filled by Islam. Middle Schoolers in Tennessee were taught to write the Shahada, the Islamic statement of faith. This was not an isolated incident:

“According to parents, students were not informed of the translation or of the specific meaning of the Arabic text the students were being asked to copy. In addition, parents confirm that female students were invited to don Muslim apparel and subsequently were photographed in costume by the teacher. (Reportedly, an administrator has since disposed of the photos.) “A post-assignment emergency meeting held with the teacher, a parent, and schools administration yielded the following additional information: Teacher Laporte was aware of the translation of the text assigned and was unapologetic over the assignment itself

Apparel representing other religions was not presented in the lesson

Teacher Laporte previously had circulated a Koran in the classroom, but had intentionally declined to make a Bible available because ‘all of the students already have read or seen a Bible’

School administration confirmed that this lesson was not in the Augusta School Division’s approved curriculum for World Geography”

Would this be allowed if the students were being taught the first fundamental step in converting to Christianity, or even any other religion?

Apparently the school doesn’t want to talk about it, because they are closing early for Christmas Winter break because the “tone” of the outrage from people who have a problem with the school teaching kids to recite a statement of Islamic faith…

It just goes to prove that some people still think “separation of church and state” is the law of the land… but only Christian churches.

7,"December 22, 2015—As the GOP candidates continue to compete for the title of Republican nominee, the Democratic side of the aisle seems to be winding down.

Recent polls show Hillary Clinton as the party favorite, with Bernie Sanders quickly losing momentum and Martin O’Malley falling far behind the other two candidates. However, nothing is for certain, especially this early in the election season.

Regardless of whether or not Sanders ends up winning the primary, it is clear that his ideas will live on through his Wall-Street bashing, idealistic following. It seems to me that deflecting responsibility and blaming others is becoming a popular trend amongst millennials.

Don’t get me wrong, there are certainly aspects of Bernie Sanders that I respect. For instance, the man has stuck to his principles and preached the same message for almost 40 years. Although I vehemently disagree with the message, consistency is something to be desired.

Bernie’s crusade against Wall Street is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. Wall Street does need to be held accountable for its actions. It is also essential that we end the corruption that exists between Wall Street and the political elite. However, Sanders takes a valid concern and twists it into an unrealistic economic platform.

As a self-proclaimed “Democratic-Socialist,” Sanders is known for propagating an economic theory that holds no true merit. While his “Robbin Hood” approach of taking from the rich and giving to the poor may seem noble, there are a few economic laws that Sanders overlooks. Many of these laws could be summed up in Economics 101.

The economic platform of Bernie Sanders is built off of complete disdain for the upper-class. In paricular, Sanders is often heard preaching about the travesties of “the top 1 percent”. This evil group of elite “millionaires and billionaires” is the supposed cause of America’s economic woes.

According to Bernie, “the top 1 percent” fail to “pay their fair share” and should do more to ensure that wealth is distributed equally. Ironically enough, “the top 1 percent” already do quite a bit as far as the federal income tax is concerned. Recent statistics from the IRS show that “the top 1 percent” bear the brunt of the total federal income tax by providing 37.8% of the revenue that the federal government receives from income taxes. Of course, the states have their own tax rates that must be taken into consideration, but that’s an issue for each individual state to determine, not the president of the United States.

With “the top 1 percent” paying 37.8% of the total federal income tax, it’s hard for Sanders to claim that they don’t pay their fair share. This is especially true considering that the entire “bottom 50%” only account for 2.8% 0f the federal income tax.

As far as income distribution is concerned, “the top 1 percent” own about 19% of the income. While 19% is still a large chunk of the pie for such a small demographic, it is still less than the 25% that Sanders is inclined to quote. Again, this information comes from the IRS, a government agency.

However, it is important to note that the economic platform of Bernie Sanders digs far deeper than income inequality and wealth distribution. It has deep roots in the socialist approach of collectivism and government-imposed morality.

While Sanders and his following are quick to bash those who are “millionaires and billionaires”, they fail to see the risk that many of these individuals have taken to create jobs. They fail to see the power of financial incentives and how it drives individuals to adapt an entrepreneurial spirit. Perhaps most importantly, they attempt to force their illusion of morality upon the American public. In other words, those who “have” should be forced to give to those who “have not.”

This is not to say, of course, that we should not show compassion to our fellow human beings. It is important to be charitable, not through government mandates, but through our own devices. While it may be considered “immoral” to deny charity, it is equally “immoral”to take from one in order to benefit another. In the private sector, we call that “theft.”

So yes, let’s work to put an end to the corruption between Wall Street and Washington, D.C. Let’s work to ensure that individuals are not fraudulently taken advantage of. However, let’s stop blaming “the millionaires and billionaires” for all of our economic woes. Let’s learn to take responsibility. The “American Dream” was never meant to be an entitlement program.

Are millennials leading the country toward welfare statism? Comment below!

8,"With former New York Gov. George Pataki ending his bid for the Presidency, the crowded Republican field of wannabe leader of the free world got some breathing room — but not by much.

More candidates remain than you can count on two hands.

Here’s a list of who’s in and who’s out on the Republican side. (And below that, how the Dems are faring):

IN

Jeb Bush: He served two terms as Florida governor from 1999-2007. After opting not to run for president in both 2008 and 2012, Bush announced he is running for president on June 15, 2015.

Ben Carson: The prominent and well-respected physician only recently strayed into the political arena. His politically charged comments at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast made him a conservative media darling.

Chris Christie: Christie successfully ran for governor of New Jersey in 2009, defeating Gov. Jon Corzine in the largely Democratic state. Christie was re-elected by a large margin in 2013.

Ted Cruz: Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, after he rallied conservative and tea party support in Texas, and has since been one of the Senate’s most vocal critics of Obamacare. On March 23 he became the first Republican candidate to announce a campaign for the presidency.

Carly Fiorina: Widely known from the corporate world at such companies as AT&T and Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 in California, losing to incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Still an advocate for conservative causes, Fiorina ruled out another run for the U.S. Senate in California before declaring she’d run for president.

Mike Huckabee: Huckabee became the Arkansas governor in 1996, when Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was convicted on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Huckabee was elected to the office in 1998 and again in 2002. He was able to pull out a surprise victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses as a contender for the GOP presidential nomination, but he failed to garner significant support thereafter. Huckabee announced his 2016 candidacy in May.

John Kasich: After a nine-year stint in the private sector, Kasich ran a successful campaign for governor of Ohio in 2010, when he defeated Democratic incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland. He was re-elected by a wide margin in 2014. He declared his run for president in July.

Rand Paul: Paul gained national attention by riding the 2010 tea party wave to become the junior U.S. senator from Kentucky following a tough battle in the GOP primary. The Republican was the second candidate to declare his entrance into the 2016 presidential race, in April.

Marco Rubio: Rubio, the first Cuban-American speaker of the Florida House, won the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Florida over then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who ran as a political independent. He became the third Republican to jump into the 2016 fray in April.

Rick Santorum: Santorum served two terms in the U.S. Senate but was defeated in his bid for a third term in 2006. He ran for president in 2012, emerging from relative obscurity to win the Iowa caucuses.

Donald Trump: Trump, real estate mogul, discussed a potential presidential run for the 2000, 2008 and 2012 elections, but he had never run for any elected office. Trump announced his 2016 presidential campaign in June.

OUT

Lindsey Graham: Graham was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1992 before he ran successfully at the national level for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 and for the U.S. Senate in 2002. He ended his campaign earlier this month.

Bobby Jindal: Jindal was elected governor of Louisiana in 2007, becoming the first Indian-American governor in U.S. history. He easily won re-election in 2011 but has declined to run for a third term. He announced his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election in June, and bowed out in November.

George Pataki: Pataki served three terms as New York’s governor, including during the September 11, 2001, attacks. After speculation that he would run for President in 2008 and 2012, Pataki entered as a 2016 candidate in May. He exited Tuesday.

Rick Perry: Perry left office as Texas governor in January 2015 and declared his presidential run in June. He announced he was dropping out in September.

Scott Walker: In 2012, Walker became the only U.S. governor in history to win a recall election, following his effort to limit collective bargaining power for public sector employees. He won re-election in 2014, and in July, he declared his run for president. In September, he quit the race.

NOTE:

Jim Gilmore: Gilmore was elected governor in 1997 and served until 2002. Gilmore was a contender during the 2008 presidential election, and in July, he filed paperwork to run for president in 2016. While he has not dropped out of the race, he has not qualified for a debate or campaigned often in key states to be included in the list.

And here’s how the field looks for the Democrats:

IN

Hillary Clinton: The former first lady, ran in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries . After losing the Democratic nod to Barack Obama, she was later secretary of state. Clinton announced her second presidential bid in April.

Martin O’Malley: O’Malley was elected mayor of Baltimore and served until 2006, when he won his campaign to be the 61st governor of Maryland. O’Malley jumped into the race to the White House in May.

Bernie Sanders: After spending 16 years in the House, Sanders won election to the U.S. Senate in 2006 and is the longest-serving Independent member of Congress.

OUT

Lincoln Chafee: Chafee became an independent after losing re-election to the Senate in 2006 and was elected governor of Rhode Island in 2010. Partway through his term, Chafee switched to the Democratic Party. Chafee declared he would run for president on the Democratic ticket in June. He ended his long-shot bid in October.

Lawrence Lessig: Lessig has headed efforts to change the role of money in politics, organize a national constitutional convention and march against political corruption. Lessig launched a presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination on September 9, 2015. He dropped out in November.

Jim Webb: Webb, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a Marine, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006 and served one term. In July, he announced his Presidential run. In October, he announced his departure.

Two facts: Former President Bill Clinton has had dalliances with numerous women who were not Hillary Clinton over the course of their marriage, and Hillary Clinton is now running for president. Should the former preclude the latter’s chances? I don’t necessarily understand how that would work. But my lack of enlightenment shouldn’t stop Clinton’s rival candidates, either now or in the general election, from giving it a shot.

It is an odd thing, this debate about whether Bill Clinton’s record of sexual profligacy is appropriate to use as a political attack. The agreed-upon term of record in this meta-debate is “fair game.” As in: Is it fair game to point out that Bill Clinton had multiple extramarital affairs, one of which went down with a young intern during the 42nd president’s time in office? Can a candidate level this attack without fear of retribution, or will the chief arbiter of morality in political attacks (George Will? Howard Kurtz?) have to issue a fine?

In early 2014, Sen. Rand Paul went through a phase in which he ran around calling former President Clinton a “sexual predator” who was responsible for the real “war on women.” Paul’s wife, Kelley, had said the same thing. We’ll get to the lameness of this attack in a minute. But first let’s consider how this trial balloon was received.

After making the comments, Paul appeared on Meet the Press, which at the time was still the den of human haircut David Gregory. Gregory didn’t simply ask Paul to expand on what he and his wife meant by calling Clinton’s sexual behavior “predatory” or why he believes that Bill Clinton cheating on his wife should negatively affect his wife’s political career. He asked, instead, “Are these issues something that you really think will be fair game and an appropriate part of a campaign, should she be the nominee?” And so came other takes debating the ethics of whether candidates have permission to discuss Clinton’s affairs.

The fair-game question has been resurrected now that Donald Trump has begun talking about Clinton’s affairs. (It is a grand tradition for public figures who have their own histories of sexual misconduct—Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingston, Dennis Hastert, Henry Hyde, and now Donald Trump—to serve as mascots for the persecution of Bill Clinton’s penis.) In typical Trumpspeak, the Republican front-runner has blasted Bill Clinton’s “terrible record of women abuse.”

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2015

Since these are words that came out of Trump’s mouth, they’ve garnered more than their fair share of media attention. Trump has defended the attack as—you guessed it—“fair game.” Carly Fiorina, who serves as female validator of her male rivals’ attacks against Hillary Clinton, has also validated the appropriateness of the line using the words fair and game, in that order.

They are both correct. It is perfectly acceptable to remind people that Bill Clinton, former president and husband of the Democratic presidential front-runner, is a sleaze. Here’s a simple heuristic, in general, for determining whether a political attack is fair game: Does it attack a candidate’s not-newsworthy children? If not, then it’s probably fair game to try it out.

But just because something is fair game doesn’t mean it will be effective or even make sense. Let’s try to divine the political utility of wielding Bill Clinton’s personal shortcomings against Hillary Clinton’s campaign for the presidency.

One would be to muddy up the image of the fondly remembered former president, Hillary Clinton’s most effective proxy who’s now gearing up to join the campaign trail. The whole reason that Trump is bringing up Bill Clinton’s “women abuse” is because of reports that he’s going to start stumping for his wife. If you can turn Bill Clinton into a liability, you’ve greatly increased your chances of defeating Hillary Clinton. Just ask Barack Obama, whose campaign was able to convince much of the electorate that Bill Clinton was a thoroughgoing racist during the 2008 presidential primary. But we already have evidence that the public, on net, views Bill Clinton and his legacy favorably in spite of the Lewinsky scandal. Consider the 1998 elections or the 60-plus percent approval ratings Clinton enjoyed upon leaving office. As Fiorina herself said, after acknowledging that the criticism is fair to use in this particular game, “But you’re not going to beat Hillary Clinton by attacking Bill Clinton.”

Another possibility is to use Bill Clinton’s record as a counterattack against Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party’s description of Republicans’ “war on women.” This is why Paul was calling Clinton “predatory” last year. “The Democrats, one of their big issues is they have concocted and said Republicans are committing a war on women,” Paul told David Gregory. “One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses shouldn’t prey on young interns in their office.” Trump, too, is holding up Clinton’s mistresses as amulets against criticism of his own piggish behavior. “You look at whether it’s Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them, and that certainly will be fair game,” Trump said. “Certainly if they play the woman’s card with respect to me, that will be fair game.”

The problem here is that this is stupid. Even if one believes the war on women moniker is an overly sensationalistic piece of Democratic jargon, what it was originally drawn up to describe—the wave of efforts on state and federal levels by newly elected Republicans following the 2010 elections to restrict access to abortion, birth control, or funding for women’s health centers or WIC benefits—was a very real policy trend about which many women were very much aware and remain aware. Saying, “But Bill Clinton had an affair with an intern!” is not an effective counter to critiques of Republican policymaking priorities in the Tea Party era. It only reinforces how clueless the party is about the ill will such policymaking priorities created, especially among unmarried women.

Beyond these two ineffectual uses, all that’s left are the more hand-waving, cerebral ones, such as “Hillary Clinton is running for president, but her husband was president, and he had sex with another lady, and the Clintons are evil sex people so … vote Trump?” (This is what they all are, really.) Trump or whoever else wants to bring up Bill Clinton’s affairs as a means of tarnishing Hillary Clinton’s chances should go nuts with that. Really, it’s totally fine! It’s weird that people might think it wouldn’t be fine. But it doesn’t mean anyone will care.

That means the TSA technically shouldn't accept driver's licenses from certain states, once the law is in full effect. While Washington let the rules slide for years, the Department of Homeland Security could start to enforce them in 2016 and is pushing states to comply.

And that has the potential to cause confusion, not to mention headaches at the airport -- as many states are still not in full compliance, and different states are operating on different timetables.

Here's what to expect in the months ahead:

DHS is enforcing the legislation in stages. Currently, it is only requiring the enhanced IDs for access to federal facilities. Some states have extensions, but those are set to expire next year -- in January, June and October, depending on the state.

The bigger controversy is over what comes next. As early as 2016, DHS is expected to start enforcing the ID requirements for air travel. That means anyone from states flouting the ID rules would not be able to use their driver’s licenses to board a plane, and would have to use a passport or other accepted form of ID instead.

The below document, provided by Keeping IDentities Safe, shows a map of current state compliance under the REAL ID Act, based on DHS data.

Worried you might be affected? Well, it depends where you live.

So far, more than 20 states are in the clear because their IDs pass the test. At least 20 other states with extensions have until June or October to get in line or apply for another extension.

But a handful of other states are running up against a much-tighter deadline: California, Illinois, Missouri, New Mexico and Washington have extensions only through Jan. 10.

Of them, Illinois, Missouri and Washington state have been told Jan. 10 is the final deadline. The others are still waiting to see if they can get a grace period beyond that date. Minnesota, meanwhile, is the only non-compliant state whose extension has expired.

Eventually, all states will have to either upgrade their driver's licenses if they want residents to be able to use them to fly.

The legislation has faced opposition from both Democrats and Republicans due to privacy and cost concerns, and fears that it represents the first step toward a national ID system.

“We’re already on our way to a surveillance society and we're going to get there even faster thanks to REAL ID,” Jim Harper, Senior Fellow at the CATO Institute, told FoxNews.com.

While the immediate impact could be minimal as the law currently only applies to certain federal facilities, a DHS spokeswoman said the agency is in the process of rolling out the plans for airports.

“DHS is in the process of scheduling plans for REAL ID enforcement at airports and will ensure that the traveling public has ample notice, at least 120 days, before any changes are made that might affect their travel,” spokeswoman Amanda DeGroff told FoxNews.com, while putting the onus on the states to act.

“The REAL ID Act places the responsibility for action on the state to provide state-issued identification that meets the Act’s security standards,” DeGroff said.

While residents in non-compliant states could soon find themselves in a jam at the airport, supporters of the changes say the fault lies with states dragging their feet.

“Should citizens be frustrated by this? Yes, I think they should be, especially as one of the parties unaffected will be legal immigrants, as they have green cards which can be used to board a domestic flight,” Brian Zimmer, president of Keeping IDentities Safe -- a group that has been supportive of REAL ID, told FoxNews.com

Zimmer downplayed the immediate impact on travelers in 2016. He notes that even in some non-compliant states, such as New York, enhanced licenses are already available that will be acceptable by TSA standards. He also believes the timeline for the rollout will be lengthy.

“Such a major shift will occur first at small airports, as was the case when the earlier ID checks began in early 2008,” Zimmer said. “Technically, the 'final' airport at which REAL ID enforcement is established could be as late as 2020 -- four years from now, when the deadline of total public enrollment for REAL ID is scheduled to occur, unless a further extension occurs.”

Opponents of the law argue that the looming airport implementation is a tactic for the federal government to bully the states into complying.

“They’re going to make a great show of force in order to goad states into complying,” Harper said. “If the TSA was to turn people away at the airport, people visiting grandmothers at Easter, there’d be a great show of anger, all aimed at the TSA.”

“It’s all part of a bluff to force legislators to comply with the federal mandate,” he said.

12,"A Florida judge has set a trial date in the racketeering case against the Clinton Foundation and Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Judge Donald Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ordered the racketeering, influenced and corrupt organizations, or RICO, case to head to trial January 20, 2016.

The order, entered Friday and obtained by the Washington Examiner, came days after Larry Klayman of Freedom of Watch filed a lengthy civil complaint against the Clintons and their foundation in the same court.

While the Clinton legal team could settle the case or enter a variety of motions in an effort to derail the lawsuit before the trial, the judge's swift decision means the matter could go to court before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus and Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.

Klayman, who has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Clintons and other prominent politicians, suggested the former first couple and their family philanthropy used their political clout to drum up foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and lavish diplomatic favors for contributors while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.

Klayman also asked the judge to order a ""neutral forensic expert ... to take custody and control of the private email server and reconstruct and preserve the official U.S. Government records relating to the conduct of U.S. foreign policy during Defendant Secretary Clinton's term as Secretary of State.""

Judge Middlebrooks has not yet ruled on Klayman's request that the court seize Hillary Clinton's server.

The court documents also state the Clinton Foundation and the former first couple must discuss the Cameras in the Courtroom pilot project, an initiative in the Southern District of Florida aimed at incorporating video recordings into civil cases.

""I am pleased that the Court has set this case for early jury trial,"" Klayman told the Examiner. ""This is a matter of extreme national importance and before now, for decades, the Clintons have not had to answer to a jury for their alleged crimes. Now, justice will be done.""

13,"Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio warred Tuesday over a new ad from Bush’s super PAC that accuses the Florida senator of skipping national security hearings in favor of fundraising trips.

“Politics first: that’s the Rubio way,” says a narrator in the ad from the Bush-affiliated group Right to Rise, which plans to spend $1.4 million on television ads in Iowa over the next two weeks.

The ad notes that Rubio missed a November 18 briefing for all senators in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.

""Marco Rubio was missing, fundraising in California instead,"" the narrator says.

The Rubio team shot back aggressively, deriding the claim as “intellectual dishonesty” because the ad fails to mention that Rubio attended a higher-level security briefing on the same topic on November 17.

Speaking after an event in Clinton, Iowa, Rubio called the attack ""not accurate"" and said that Bush has become ""increasingly negative"" in his attacks.

""As a member of the intelligence committee, I have access to intelligence information that isn’t even shared with others that are not on the committee,"" Rubio argued.

""Millions and millions of dollars of spending have not changed [Bush's} fortunes and he’s become increasingly negative in his attacks,"" the Florida senator added. ""This is not new.""

Rubio's team began striking back early Tuesday when the ad was made public.

“Bush's team dishonestly omits that Marco is on the Senate's Intelligence Committee, where he attended the highest level briefings on the Paris attacks,” said Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. “No other candidate for president has received more classified Intelligence briefings or better understands the threats facing our nation today than Marco. It's sad to see Jeb's ‘joyful’ campaign reduced to such intellectual dishonesty.""

And Rubio aide Joe Pounder tweeted that Bush was also fundraising on December 2, after the San Bernardino shootings.

Right to Rise official Paul Lindsay shot back: ""The Rubio campaign is correct that Jeb Bush is, indeed, not a U.S. Senator and has not skipped critical top secret national security briefings to fundraise.""

At the time of the briefing, an aide told NBC News that Rubio skipped the November 18 meeting because he had attended a Senate Intelligence Committee briefing the previous day, which Rubio’s staff said included more in-depth classified information than what is shared with all 100 members of the United States Senate.

Rubio has come under fire for missing votes in the Senate in favor of campaign events. The Florida senator has countered that other previous presidential candidates also played hooky from their Senate jobs during the heat of the campaigns.

Another GOP candidate, Gov. Chris Christie, also took Rubio to task Tuesday over his record on missing Senate votes.

""Dude, show up,"" he told voters at a town hall in Muscatine, Iowa. ""Vote. If you don't want to, quit.""

Asked to respond, Rubio shot back that Christie himself has been absent from his home state during the campaign.

""Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time,"" Rubio said.

""Candidates, I think, as we get down the stretch here, some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks,"" he added. ""And that’s fine, we’re going to continue to campaign on what I'm going to do when I'm president.

Senior U.S. military commanders on Wednesday accused Iran's military of “highly provocative” actions in firing unguided rockets 1,500 yards from ships including an American aircraft carrier.

The USS Harry S. Truman was crossing international waters in the Strait of Hormuz when Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRCGN) conducted a live-fire exercise right nearby, according to a statement.

An Iranian navy attack craft fired several unguided rockets near the carrier, officials said. A French frigate, the U.S. destroyer USS Bulkeley and other commercial traffic were also in the area at the time of Saturday's incident.

Only 23 seconds warning was given before the weapons were fired, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kyle Raines, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command.

The rockets were not fired at the Truman and other ships, and there were no direct communications between U.S. and Iranian navies, military officials said.

“The IRGCN's actions were highly provocative,” Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet, said Wednesday in a statement.

“Firing weapons so close to passing coalition ships and commercial traffic within an internationally recognized maritime traffic lane is unsafe, unprofessional, and inconsistent with international maritime law.”

Nobody from Iran's foreign or defense ministries gave official comment, but the country's state-run news agency, Fars, said in its report of the event that no vessel was in danger.

The incident was a planned training exercise and all vessels in the area had been warned, it said.

The official said the U.S. ships were in the ""internationally recognized maritime traffic lane"" at the time, not in any territorial waters, when the Iranian navy announced over maritime radio that it was about to conduct a live-fire exercise and asked other vessels to remain clear.

After the warning, the rockets were fired from a position about 1,500 yards off the carrier's starboard side and in a direction away from passing coalition and commercial ships and the traffic lane, the official said. The rockets were not fired at the Truman and other ships, only near them.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3yq8gu/us_carrier_harry_s_truman_has_close_call_with/,nbcnews.com

16,"A Turkish televangelist has warned male Muslims away from masturbation - because it may leave their hands pregnant in the afterlife.

Mücahid Cihad Han supposedly made the claim in response to a call from a man who ""kept masturbating, although he was married, and even during the Umrah"", a pilgrimage similar to the Hajj.

Hearing the man's plight, Han stated that masturbation is forbidden in Islam and went on to say: ""Moreover, one hadith states that those who have sexual intercourse with their hands will find their hands pregnant in the afterlife, complaining against them to God over its rights"".

The self-styled televangelist simply told the caller to ""resist Satan's temptations""

Tweeters took the opportunity to mock Han, with one asking: ""Are there any hand-gynaecologists in the afterlife? Is abortion allowed there?""

Masturbation is a controversial topic in Islam, as the Qur'an makes no mention of it, leaving Muslim scholars and clerics to make their own interpretations.

A limited number of rulings condemn the act as haram (forbidden), while many simply put it in the category of makruh, or ""disliked"". Some interpretations also allow masturbation under certain circumstances, with a 14th century scholar ruling: ""If a man is turned between continued desire or releasing it, and if this man does not have a wife and he fears he will suffer because of this (someone like a prisoner, or a pauper), then it is permissible for him to masturbate.""

17,"Often, when a movie or a novel wants to use a truly vapid slogan for a pretend political campaign, the writers will fall back on the phrase “Now more than ever.” It’s so broad and vague as to be utterly meaningless. Yet it’s precisely what popped into my mind today when I thought about the pressing need for educating the public, both young and old, about the wonders of the United States Constitution.

The first thing that reminded me how important our Constitution is came from a New York Times video about the mob slaughter of a 27-year-old Afghani woman named Farkhunda Malikzada. Despite surprisingly brave police efforts, a howling mob beat Farkhunda to death for burning a Koran and then, in a bow to the modern world in which these savages live, used smart phones to video the attack:

Afghanistan, a Muslim country, has nothing close to our Constitution. There is no freedom of speech (which our Supreme Court long ago said included burning symbolically significant items, provided the burner isn’t destroying someone else’s property); no freedom of religion (in Islamic countries, apostasy means death and members of other faiths are killed, enslaved, exiled, or subject to second class treatment); and no due process. Mobs exist everywhere, of course, but the ethos in America is (or used to be) freedom of speech and religion, as well as due process.

The second thing that reminded me how important our Constitution is was a lunchtime conversation revealing that, thanks to one hundred years of Leftist attacks on the Constitution, too many people in America don’t appreciate its centrality to the free, prosperous lives they enjoy. We already have way too much evidence that today’s young people, raised in the incubator of public schools and American universities, will cheerfully disavow any Constitutional rights to speech, religion, due process, etc. What’s so disturbing is to see that this disregard for the Constitution has filtered upstream to older people who should know better.

It started today with a lunch-time trip to Chick-fil-A, a destination that the teens enjoy because it’s tasty fast food served in a rather civilized setting. With us was a highly educated 50-something who grumbled about going there because the company’s owners are “homophobic.” I explained to the teens that there’s a difference between being homophobic and opposing gay marriage. I, for example, am not homophobic, but also do not support gay marriage.

Rather than leave that notion just hanging there, I did a two-minute shtick for the short-attention span teens and the hostile-attention span 50-something. Distilled to its essence, my unwillingness to support gay marriage goes as follows:

When the United States came into being, European countries did not separate church and state — especially England, which was the dominant cultural influence on America, where the head of the state is also the head of the church. Marriage was therefore simultaneously a religious and a civil institution.

When America came into being, it never occurred to anyone that marriage has two distinct aspects: religious, which involves a religious institution joining two people before God, and civil, which sees a government formally unite two people for the purpose of bestowing upon them all sorts of government-approved benefits, including tax breaks and parenting benefits.

As long as society agreed that marriage was a man-woman thing, this melding of church and state worked for marriage because, while religious institutions and the government had different benefits to offer, both those benefits went to the same type of union. Gay marriage, however, revealed a schism: Not only to religious and civil institutions bestow different types of benefits on “marriage,” they also define marriage differently.

The intelligent way to approach gay “marriage” would have been for the government to get out of the “marriage” business and get into the “civil union” business. This would allow it to bestow a civil blessing on whatever the heck kind of unions the public will accept. What happened instead was that Anthony Kennedy found a magic, invisible gay marriage clause in the Constitution.

The inevitable result of the Supreme Court’s decision — and one the more politicized gays on my real-me Facebook feed are lusting after — will be a profound Constitutional crisis as gay marriage proponents attack religious institutions for refusing to perform gay marriages. The Supreme Court will then be asked which Constitutional right trumps in that situation: the magical, invisible gay marriage right or the explicit First Amendment religious freedom right. If we get another Democrat president in the White House (or Donald Trump, who is pulling an Obama/Hillary on gay marriage and “evolving”), and with that President one or two new Supreme Court judges, there is no guarantee that the explicit First Amendment religious freedom right will win. If you doubt me, look at how gay marriage has trumped traditional religion in England.

I know that seems like a lot of content, but if you talk fast, you can say all of the above in 90 seconds.

The teens listened silently. The 50-something, highly-educated Leftist had something to say, though. “That’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. It makes no sense. We can’t be controlled and held back by that kind of stuff.” [The visual you should have now is of me sitting in Chick-fil-A repeatedly banging my head against the table.] All I could do in response to his efforts to shut me down was to keep saying to the kids “The Constitution is the most important document in the world because it protects you from your own government and ensures your freedoms.”

Serendipitously, I got a fund-raising email today from Hillsdale College asking for money and making my point about both the Constitution’s centrality to individual liberty and about the century-long Leftist effort to destroy it. I reprint the email here:

As you know the Constitution is America’s fundamental law and the bulwark of American liberty and prosperity. Today it is under siege, and restoring its predominance in our government is the key to reviving and securing liberty for our children and grandchildren. This is the crisis of our time—and it’s one you can partner with us to solve by making your year-end gift to Hillsdale College by December 31. The heart of the problem is that too few Americans today know or understand the importance of the Constitution to liberty. For that you can thank an educational system that has been hijacked by Progressive ideology. Woodrow Wilson, one of the original Progressives, famously said that the goal was to “make the young gentlemen of the rising generation as unlike their fathers as possible,” and that Americans needed to “get beyond” the Declaration of Independence—the charter document of American liberty! This hijacking of our educational system threatens your freedom and mine. Yet I have hope. We know the truth. And with your help, I believe America can return to the limited, constitutional government our Founding Fathers intended us to have. I don’t think it will be easy. In fact, it will likely come at great cost. But a movement is growing. And thanks to you we’ve made great headway in sharing the truth about America’s founding principles –we’re proud that an astounding 600,000 people have already taken Hillsdale’s “Constitution 101” online course. Those who have enrolled in this course tell us that it makes them better citizens—and stronger defenders of liberty. But we need to reach many more Americans, especially as we head into the critical year of 2016. Will you make a generous year-end gift to reach more American citizens with the truth about the Constitution and its underlying principles of liberty? Next year is crucial to the future of liberty in America. Help Hillsdale in promoting and teaching the principles of liberty and the Constitution through a nationwide educational outreach campaign by making a special tax-deductible gift beforeDecember 31. Thank you for all you do to preserve liberty in America. Warm regards,

Larry P. Arnn

President, Hillsdale College

Pursuing Truth • Defending Liberty since 1844

Please consider giving some money to Hillsdale. I’d also like to remind you all of the inestimably valuable Bill of Rights Institute (which I wrote about here).

The takeaway lesson from all of the ideas and facts I’ve set out above is that, if we are to save the young people and marginalize those Leftist old people, we need to act and do so fast and hard. Just as the American higher education system has shown how effective misinformation is, we need to start showing how valuable true information and education are.

18,"Now we know why Bernie Sanders is so anxious to change the subject to Glass-Steagall when the Wall Street Crash of 2008 comes up. It turn out Mr. Independent Progressive (or is it Progressive Independent?) voted for the 2000 legislation that deregulated derivatives, credit default swaps and other exotic financial instruments that tanked the economy eight years later.

Let’s assume that Sanders never read the background report on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. (Yeah, like Hillary Clinton never read the background report on the resolution in support of Dubya’s invasion of Iraq, something that Sanders has repeatedly pounded her on.)

But there it is in black and white, or rather red and blue: Sanders’ vote in the House on the very legislation that greased the skids for banks and other financial institutions to run roughshod without any messy government oversight.

The act was stealthily tucked into a bloated 11,000 page conference report when no one was looking, and passed by a lopsided 377-4 margin during a lame-duck session with a veto-proof majority -- not that it needed one. President Clinton, who had been lobbying behind the scenes in support of the act while publicly harrumphing about the evils of deregulation, signed it into law without batting an eye.

Buried in the act was a yummy provision exempting Enron and other companies from energy trading regulatory oversight.

Not coincidentally, in the years before the energy giant self destructed, it was a generous contributor to Texas Senator Phil Gramm, he of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, and later presidential candidate John MCain’s “financial adviser.” Gramm's wife Wendy was paid over $1 million in salary, stock options, dividends and other goodies from 1993 to 2001 as an Enron board member, but of course was deaf, dumb and blind to the energy company's rampant books cooking with the acquiescence of the late unlamented Arthur Andersen accounting company.

Sanders’ complicity in the passage of the Commodities Futures Modernization Act may help explain his fixation on restoration of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which barred commercial banks from investing in the very speculative financial deals which contributed significantly to the 2008 meltdown. (President Clinton also supported the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which overturned Glass-Steagall.)

↓ Story continues below ↓

Many of Hillary Clinton’s top donors have, of course, been Too Big to Fail financial institutions, and she has said she would not restore Glass-Steagall, opting instead to better regulate speculators, whatever that means.

Any vote can come back and haunt a politician. But Sanders is not just any politician, which has been a substantial part of his charm and the reason his improbable campaign for the Democratic nomination has had real legs.

19,"When High School Students Know More About ‘Gender Equality’ Than Grammar…

An Oklahoma High School girl struck back at the patriarchy in an attempt to start yet another stupid feminist social justice movement because she doesn’t like covering up her crotch.

Watch below:

I like how the “objective” news reporter at the end shows her support by wearing the shirt and hashtag the dumb girl is suggesting everyone wear.

From KSWO:

The story behind a Lawton student’s dress code violation went viral after she posted her story to social media. MacArthur High School junior Rose Lynn says she was sent home twice for violating the school’s dress code on Dec. 11.

She says she was told her outfit was inappropriate by her English teacher and her principal, because her shirt did not cover her crotch while she wore leggings and that it would be a distraction to the boys. Lynn went home upset and said she felt singled out by her teachers.

After already missing a math test she had studied for all week, she decided to take a stand. “I ran up to the Dollar Tree grabbed a shirt grabbed a Sharpie, told the lady to hold it and then we wrote the comments,” Lynn said. The shirt read, “It Doesn’t Cover your CROTCH” on the front and, “You’ll distract the boy’s,” on the back. Lynn’s mom, Misti Delgado, says her daughter sent her a text before she went back to school with a picture of the shirt she had made.

I’ll be honest with you, the comment I said to her was if that’s what they said and this is what you are doing, be prepared for the consequences,” Delgado said. When Lynn returned to school wearing the shirt, she was told again to go back home to change her clothes.

Despite being reprimanded Delgado says she stands by her daughter’s decision. “She didn’t come back to school with a gun, she came back to school with a T-shirt. She is not out to harm anybody or anything like that. She came back with a T-shirt of the words told to her that she would distract the boys,” Delgado said. Lynn says she hopes to bring light to an issue she feels is constantly overlooked in school, gender bias.

“Young boys, they walk around with their pants around their knees, they wear muscle shirts in class, they wear tank tops in class…I could say ‘well his triceps are nice, they’re distracting me.’ Whereas my education is not taking the priority, whereas they’re walking around school in what you could say is the same provocative clothing as the young ladies,” Lynn said.

Uhhh yeah, that would be an account of something that liberals don’t ever learn – boys and girls are different. Thanks for playing, genius.

Bonus reason to give up hope for America – check out her excellent High School level grammar genius from the shirt:

Here’s the rambling text from the post:

So today I was sent home from class, after being in school for two hours, for my outfit. Because I’m developed farther than the average girl my age, I am required to go home and change. Yet, if I was skin and bones or over weight, (not to offend anyone) I would be over looked and no comment would be made, (AT MY PARTICULAR SCHOOL.) Because “they must do that to feel better about themselves and they crave attention” But because I look like a CURVY woman and may distract young boys, I have to miss class and change my outfit. So once again, Society has failed to advocate young ladies, by confining them in a box, where they are stripped from their sense of self respect and self expression, rather than teaching young men to respect the boundaries of young ladies. My response : ‪#‎Feminism‬ ‪#‎YoullDistractTheBoys‬‪#‎SocietyIsFailing‬

This young feminist will know all about how to whine and cry about the patriarchy, but doesn’t know simple middle school level grammar. Awesome.

It’s really a shame to see America’s youth seduced by idiotic feminism and hashtag activism. They’re learning to be useless political agents with little other value.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3yqjyt/when_high_school_students_know_more_about_gender/,soopermexican.com

The progressives have undermined American security and damaged race relations.

The Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky once described Stalinism as “the perfect theory for glueing up the brain.” What he meant was that a regime as monstrous as Stalin’s, which murdered 40 million people and enslaved many times more, was nonetheless able to persuade progressives and “social justice” advocates all over the world to act as its supporters and defenders. These enlightened enablers of Stalin’s crimes included leading intellectuals of the day, even Nobel Prize winners in the sciences and the arts such as Frederic Joliot-Curie and Andre Gide. But brilliant as they were, they were blind to the realities of the Stalinist regime and, therefore, to the virtues of the free societies they lived in.

What glued up their brains was the belief that a brave new world of social justice — a world governed by progressive principles — existed in embryo in Soviet Russia and had to be defended by any means necessary. As a result of this illusion, they put their talents and prestige at the service of the totalitarian enemies of democracy, acting, in Trotsky’s words, as “frontier guards” for the Stalinist empire. And they continued their efforts even after the Soviets conquered Eastern Europe, acquired nuclear weapons, and initiated a “cold war” with the West. To the progressives seduced by Stalinism, democratic America represented a greater evil than the barbaric police states of the Soviet bloc. Even half a century later a progressive culture still refers to the formative phase of the Cold War as the “Red Scare” — as though the fifth column of American progressives whose loyalties were to the Soviet enemy, whose members included Soviet spies, was not a matter of serious concern, and as though a nuclear-armed, rapacious Soviet empire did not pose a credible threat.

How were these delusions of otherwise intelligent and well-intentioned people possible? How were otherwise informed individuals able to deny the obvious and support one of the most brutal and oppressive dictatorships in history? How did they come to view a relatively humane, decent, and democratic society like the United States as evil, while regarding the barbarous Communist regime as the victim of America? The answer lies in the identification of Marxism with the promise of social justice and the institution of progressive values ( to take place in a magical socialist future). Defense of the progressive idea trumped recognition of the reactionary fact.

To Western progressives, once the Stalinist regime was identified with the imaginary progressive future, everything followed — its status as a persecuted victim and America’s role as a reactionary force standing in the way of the noble leftist aspiration. Every fault of Stalin’s regime, every crime it committed — if not denied outright by progressives — was attributed to the nefarious actions of its enemies, most glaringly the United States. And once the promise of progressive redemption was juxtaposed to an imperfect real-world actor, all of their responses became virtually inevitable. Hence, the glueing of the brain.

RELATED: Black Lives Matters’ Agenda Is Costing Black Lives

The Soviet Union is gone, and history has moved on. But the Stalin-apologist dynamic endures as the heritage of a post-Communist Left, which remains wedded to fantasies of an impossibly beautiful future that collides with the flawed American present. The Left is now the dominant force in the American Democratic party. Its extreme disconnect from realities is encapsulated in the support for the transparently racist movement called “Black Lives Matter,” which attacks law enforcement and defends street predators, excusing their crimes with the alibi that “white supremacists” created the circumstances that make some commit criminal acts. This extremist movement has the “strong support” of the entire spectrum of the “progressive” Left (including 46 percent of the Democratic party, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC news poll).

Black Lives Matter is a movement built on the fiction that police have declared open season on innocent black Americans.

Black Lives Matter is a movement built on the fiction that police have declared open season on innocent black Americans. According to progressive fictions, police are the agents of a “white supremacist society” — a claim alone that should make one wary of the sanity of those who advance it. The facts belie the very basis of the claim that African Americans are being indiscriminately gunned down by police: African-American males, accounting for 6 percent of the population are responsible for more than 40 percent of violent crimes. But a Washington Post report on all 980 police shootings of 2015 reveals that only 4 percent of fatal police shootings involved white officers and black victims, while in “three-quarters of the incidents, cops were either under attack themselves or defending civilians,” or, as Michael Walsh observed in the New York Post, police officers were “in other words, doing their jobs.”

One incident in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., became the launching point for the Black Lives Matter movement and its malicious claim that innocent blacks were being wantonly gunned down by racist police. The alleged “victim,” Michael Brown, had just committed a strong-armed robbery and refused to comply with Officer Darren Wilson’s order to surrender. Instead the 300-pound street thug attacked Wilson in his vehicle, tried to wrest his gun from him, and then walked away before turning and charging him. Several shots failed to stop Brown, until one killed him.

Ignoring the facts, Black Lives Matter promoted the lie, invented by Brown’s robbery accomplice, that Brown had his hands up and was attempting to surrender when he was shot. “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” quickly became the anthem of the movement. But this lie was refuted not only by black eyewitnesses testifying before the grand jury convened for the case and by forensic evidence, but by a review conducted by former attorney general Eric Holder’s Justice Department, otherwise bent on demonstrating the existence of bigotry in the Ferguson police department. Meanwhile “protesters” went about setting fire to Ferguson, causing millions of dollars of damage, because if there was no justice — no hanging of Wilson — there would be no peace, as the now familiar mob slogan framed it.

Black Lives Matter then set about taking its crusade to other cities, most prominently to Baltimore, where a career criminal named Freddie Gray became another cause célèbre. Gray had suffered fatal injuries inside a police van where only another captive was present. As the Black Lives Matter–inspired mobs began to gather in “protest,” Baltimore’s black Democratic mayor ordered police to stand down, allowing them to destroy millions of dollars of property. The state’s black Democratic prosecutor then indicted six police officers, three of them African American, on various ludicrous charges including first-degree murder.

#share#The immediate result of Black Lives Matter’s war on law enforcement was an epidemic of crime, as police officers decided that aggressive law enforcement was dangerous to their lives and careers. Homicides in the Ferguson area and in Baltimore jumped 60 percent. Virtually all the victims were blacks, revealing the hypocrisy of a movement for which black lives didn’t really matter — attacks on the law enforcement and on the “power structure” did.

How could any reasonable citizen — let alone one with progressive aspirations — support a roving lynch mob like the one in Ferguson? How could half the Democratic party support a movement that condemns America as a white-supremacist society, disregarding the reality that the president and chief law-enforcement officer, and thousands of civil servants and elected officials, including the mayors and police chiefs of large urban centers, such as Memphis, Tenn., Atlanta, and Philadelphia are black? (In Detroit the new mayor is actually the first white mayor in 40 years, while its police chief is still black.)

One can embrace the absurdity that America is a white-supremacist society only if afflicted with the illusion that all statistical inequalities affecting African Americans, like high crime rates, are not reflections of culture and character but marks of racist oppression. (This particular absurdity — universal as it is among American progressives and the current U.S. Department of Justice — is easily refuted: If statistical disparities proved racism, the National Basketball Association in which 95 percent of the starting multimillionaires are black would be an association controlled by black racists, as would the National Football League, while the National Hockey League would be under the thumb of white racists.) Progressives are delusional about black racism and black crime because they are in thrall to the vision of an imaginary progressive future in which social justice will guarantee that every individual outcome is the same.

The Left is blind to the responsibility of inner-city populations for their off-the-charts violent-crime rates.

The Left is blind to the responsibility of inner-city populations for their off-the-charts violent-crime rates. The failure to embrace the responsibilities of parenthood is as characteristic of the progressive attitude as is its blindness to the betrayal of inner-city communities by Democrats, responsible almost entirely for the disgraceful condition of America’s cities. Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, St. Louis, and numerous other centers of out-of-control black poverty, failed public-school systems, and black-on-black violence are 100 percent controlled by the Democratic party and have been so for 50 to 100 years. Yet 95 percent of the black vote and 100 percent of the progressive vote continues to go to Democrats who oppress African Americans.

Unfortunately, progressives’ sordid history of supporting criminals at home is accompanied by an equally dishonorable record of sympathy for America’s enemies abroad. The Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was one of the monsters of the 20th century, launching two aggressive wars, dropping poison gas on the Kurdish minority, and murdering 300,000 Iraqi citizens. But when America proposed deposing him, more than a million progressives poured into the streets in protest. At first, the Democratic leadership supported the Iraq invasion as a just and necessary war. But three months later, with American men and women still in harm’s way — and under pressure from the progressive Left — they turned against the very war they had voted to authorize and, for the next five years, conducted a malicious propaganda campaign, worthy of the enemy, to discredit America’s intentions and to obstruct our military mission.

Because the Bush administration chose not to defend itself by confronting the Left’s subversive actions — including the exposure of three national-security programs — leftist myths about the Iraq War persist to this day, even in some conservative circles. To set the record straight: Bush did not lie to seduce Democrats into supporting the war, and could not have done so, since the Democrats had access to the same intelligence reports he did. The war was not about extant stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, as Democrats dishonestly claimed: It was about Saddam’s violation of 17 U.N. Security Council resolutions designed to prevent him from pursuing the WMD programs he was developing. The Democrats’ betrayal of their country’s war effort crippled its progress and, with the election to the presidency of an anti-war leftist in 2008, led directly to the explosion of terrorism and bloodshed that has since engulfed the Middle East.

But it wasn’t just the surrender mentality of the Obama administration that fueled these catastrophes. With the full support of the Democratic party, President Obama embraced the Muslim Brotherhood and America’s mortal enemy, Iran, providing its ayatollahs with a path to nuclear weapons and dominance of the region — causing Sunni Arab states to prepare for a Middle Eastern civil war.

Just as leftists acted as propagandists for the Soviet empire, discrediting America’s Cold War effort and conducting deceptive campaigns to hide Soviet crimes, so the Left today disparages the Islamist threat and opposes the security measures necessary to protect the homeland — most alarmingly the sealing of our southern border. Progressives have created seditious “sanctuary cities,” which refuse to cooperate with Homeland Security and the immigration laws in more than 300 outlaw municipalities under Democratic control. This betrayal has gone un-reversed for years and led to the needless deaths of numerous American citizens at the hands of illegal-alien criminals, of which there are more than 200,000 in our jails alone, and obviously many more inside our borders.

Leftists and Democrats have also joined the Islamist propaganda campaign to represent Muslims — whose co-religionists have killed hundreds of thousands of innocents since 9/11 in the name of their religion — as victims of anti-Muslim prejudice, denouncing critics of Islamist terror and proponents of security measures as “Islamophobes” and bigots. But in truth, 60 percent of religious hate crimes are directed at Jews, with a small minority directed a Muslims.

#related#Exploiting the myth of Muslim persecution, progressives oppose scrutiny of the Muslim community, including terror-promoting imams and mosques. They immediately denounce proposals to screen Muslim immigrants as religious bigotry, and thus close off any rational discussion of the problem. Led by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Democrats have enabled the Islamist assault on free speech, which is a central component of the Islamist campaign to create a worldwide religious theocracy. Most notoriously the president and his operatives cynically spread the lie that an obscure Internet video about Mohammed was behind the Benghazi terror attack. Speaking like an ayatollah before the U.N. General Assembly, shortly after the attack, Obama declared: “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.” What an American president should have said is: “The future must not belong to those who murder in the name of Islam.”

Shane Bauer knows firsthand what it’s like to be a prisoner in Iran. And after news broke Saturday morning about the exchange that delivered four imprisoned Americans, he had plenty to say about Hillary Clinton’s response to the developments in Iran.

In a series of tweets posted late Saturday night, Bauer, who is now a senior reporter at Mother Jones, called Clinton’s appeal for more sanctions “totally irresponsible” and accused her of constantly inflaming tensions with Iran.

Story Continued Below

“Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions *now*? As far as we know, 4 of the Americans are still in Iran. Totally irresponsible,” he tweeted.

In her response to the prisoner exchange and implementation day of the Iran nuclear agreement, Clinton noted that one American, Bob Levinson, is still being held in Iran. Observing that “Iran is still violating UN Security Council resolution with its ballistic missile program,” Clinton called for “new sanctions designations and firm resolve.”

Four Americans detained in Iran — Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari — were released as part of the exchange. A fifth American in custody, a student by the name of Matthew Trevithick, was released separately on Saturday.

Bauer also tweeted that while he was imprisoned in Iran, “whenever I heard Hillary’s voice, my heart would sink. All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions.”

He expressed shock, or perhaps sarcasm, at the fact that Clinton — the Democratic front-runner in a narrow primary of three — was calling for sanctions, rather than Republican front-runners Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.

25,"Even as the president celebrates a U.S. auto sales record, there are signs that the car bubble his policies helped inflate is already beginning to burst.

In his final State of the Union address, President Obama bolstered his economic credentials with what appears to be an uncontroversial fact: “Our auto industry just had its best year ever.” Sure enough, with just under 17.5 million vehicles sold, 2015 was indeed the highest annual sales volume ever recorded.

But not everyone in the industry shares the president’s triumphal perspective on the auto sector. In fact, just hours before the State of the Union began, the CEO of one of the country’s largest car dealership chains warned the industry that old, bad habits threaten to undo one of the president’s most cherished economic accomplishments.

Only days later, a lawsuit against Fiat-Chrysler alleges the automaker faked some of those record sales. Even as the president celebrates a U.S. auto sales record, there are signs that the car bubble his policies helped inflate is already beginning to burst.

No Buyers? Make More Vehicles

Speaking at the Automotive News World Congress adjoining the Detroit Auto Show, AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson warned that new car sales are unlikely to climb much past 2015’s record-setting number, an unusual argument for a car dealer to champion. The very optimism that seems so innate in car dealers and manufacturers alike, he argued, could turn a mere slowdown into another disaster.

‘Don’t be in denial. We’ve failed this test every time.’

Calling the entire industry “clueless” about managing slowdowns, he said, “We’ve never done it. Don’t be in denial. We’ve failed this test every time.”

Jackson said every auto manufacturer he had met with at the Detroit show had planned on growing sales in 2016, which he called a “recipe for disaster” in light of slowing demand. Pointing to the growth of “stair-step” incentives, where automakers provide bonuses to dealers who meet volume goals, he predicted rising inventories and shrinking margins unless the industry demonstrates unprecedented discipline.

“If everybody is ambitious in their plans and then produces to support that plan and inventory explodes and we have to push back, then you’ve lost control,” he warned.

Easy Money Fuels Bad Habits

The bad habits Jackson describes have crept back into the business over the course of the recovery, thanks to a rising tide of cheap auto credit fueled by low Federal Reserve interest rates. The low-rate environment has lowered the costs for lenders and boosted institutional demand for auto loan-backed securities, which not only brought more buyers into the market through subprime expansion but also helped them buy more expensive trucks and SUVs with extended loan terms.

Since car buyers are more indebted and face longer pay-off periods than ever, rising rates are likely to knock them out of the market for longer.

The average term for new car loans has climbed above 65 months, the average amount financed is breaking records as it approaches $28,000 per sale, and subprime loans make up 22 percent of the market, up from 17 percent in 2009. At General Motors, automotive revenue was actually down during the first three quarters of last year’s record-breaking sales, with finance revenue providing much of the growth.

With automakers and car buyers equally addicted to cheap credit, the Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates heralds an end to the party. The New York Fed has warned that each 100 basis-point increase in interest rates could cause a 12 percent decrease in auto production, and Fitch has pointed out the potential knock-on effects on auto loan-backed securities.

Since car buyers are more indebted and face longer pay-off periods than ever, rising rates are likely to knock them out of the market for longer regardless of how much automakers slash prices and profits. Ford got a small taste of this scenario late last year, when its “Friends and Neighbors” incentive program—which offered discounts of up to $10,000 on some models—failed to drive sales because it lacked a 0 percent credit offer.

Potential for Unbought Cars Glutting Car Lots

If the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates over the next four years, automakers will have to cut into their finance profits to subsidize the loans deals needed to keep the market at its high-paced rate. With automakers telling dealers like Jackson that they plan on continuing to grow sales, it won’t take long for this competitive pressure to turn the entire business into a profitless nightmare.

It won’t take long for this competitive pressure to turn the entire business into a profitless nightmare.

Dealers who have been suckered into giant inventories with stair-step incentives will be left holding the bag. Factories and suppliers that ramped up capacity during the credit-fueled boom will cut production and jobs as the auto bubble unravels and reverts to the wider economy’s disappointing mean.

This scenario is not inevitable, but unless the industry heeds the warnings from Jackson and others it could become more likely than anyone wants to believe. Already there are signs that the Obama auto bubble is unraveling: in addition to allegations that Fiat Chrysler falsified sales to hit volume targets, Deutsche Bank is investigating whether its employees exaggerated demand for auto loan-backed securities.

Unfortunately, the president’s sense of ownership of the auto sector’s apparent success has him cheering on big sales numbers instead of adding his voice to the calls for caution. Apparently even he fails to understand that a major component of his legacy—not to mention the U.S. economy—could be at stake if he continues to cheer the auto industry over a cliff.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/41e11r/obama_cheers_the_auto_industry_over_a_cliff/,thefederalist.com
26,"Andrew Breitbart famously said “politics is downstream of culture”, which is the succinct answer to the not infrequent questions authors like myself get about why we’re taking up space on political news sites like Hot Air with posts about things like movies and video games. Essentially, the stories we share with each other control the way we think about almost everything, and these are some of the most powerful storytelling tools available to us. What people “know” about something can be forever changed after just a couple hours in the theater, and that is why it’s so important to both share those experiences and learn to create them by watching the masters at work.

Until this weekend, the story of the 2012 attack on our consulate in Benghazi has been almost exclusively in the hands of the Obama Administration (and the media, but I repeat myself), who have spun a yarn about faulty intelligence leading them to believe a Youtube video caused a spontaneous protest that turned violent and could not have been prevented or mitigated. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi now puts that story in the hands of Michael Bay.

Like most people familiar with Bay’s work, when I first saw his name in that trailer I snarked about his ability to tackle such a controversial event in recent history. Not only has every film he’s done since Transformers become dumber and less coherent, but I remember sitting through the interminably painful romance that ate up the majority of Pearl Harbor‘s running time. The best I thought we could hope for here was a more competent version of Act of Valor, which conservatives loved, liberals loathed, and I thought just sucked in general.

Much to my surprise, Bay has instead delivered a poignant and harrowing view of the events of September 11, 2012 from the perspective of the people who were there in Benghazi as it unfolded. In fact, 13 Hours is so well constructed that had it not been for some of the usual shots and frenetic editing that distinctly mark the film as one of Bay’s, I would believe he let someone else direct it for him.

However, although those Bay-isms do pop up here and there, most of the things that bother people about his films are either gone or at the very least heavily subdued compared to his movies of late. Instead of jumping right into an explosion fest, Bay starts us off with a brief recap of how we got into Libya in the first place, followed by about an hour of setting the stage for what’s to come that starts with us meeting our team of ex-soldiers contracted to protect the CIA annex. They’re a frustrated and often bored bunch stuck in a base protecting people who don’t seem to appreciate what they do, surrounded by potential threats, and constantly at odds with a boss who seems to consider them more of a liability than anything else.

That boss is the CIA station chief at the annex played by David Costabile, not President Obama, Hillary Clinton, or some kind of caricature of either as you might expect. Other than a snippet of one of Obama’s speeches, they are completely absent from the film, and by leaving them out, Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan wisely avoid having the story they are telling sidetracked by political concerns. Instead they are able to hammer home the horrible truths about Benghazi that have thus far been written off as Republican political pandering.

We are shown a woefully unfortified consulate whose defense is left almost entirely in the hands of unreliable Libyan allies. It is not overrun by a protest that got out of hand, and there is pointed dialog noting that fact later in the movie. Rather it is attacked by Islamic militants who spend days casing both it and the CIA annex before they execute a series of clearly coordinated and planned assaults. And more infuriating than anything else, we watch as calls for backup continue to go unheeded for hours, with fighter jets sitting unmanned on the tarmac as the Americans desperately fight to repel waves of well armed terrorists.

Even our heroes are explicitly and repeatedly told to “stand down” despite the frantic pleas from the Consulate that “if you don’t come, we’re going to f*cking die!”

Bound by their conscience, these valiant men defy their orders and go anyway, and that’s when the movie really gets going. From then on it’s a tense, gripping affair that left me quietly seething in anger watching these guys get hung out to dry by a government that couldn’t or wouldn’t send help. Even Bay’s hyper-edited shaky cam, which is somewhat annoying during that first hour of setup, is used to great effect here, reinforcing the feeling of disorientation and uncertainty these guys clearly have to work through. For once not being able to tell who is whom works in the movie’s favor because neither could they at times.

It’s not all action either. There are appropriate moments of unsettling calm, and since it’s Bay, there are jokes peppered throughout, but not of the typical childish variety we normally see from him. We get more of a gallows humor the guys use to break the tension for themselves as much as it does for us, and though the primary focus is on the pseudonymous Jack Silva played by John Krasinski, and Tyrone Woods played by James Badge Dale, 13 Hours has a great ensemble cast making it all work together.

I also have to give props to Lorne Balfe for creating a score that’s reminiscent of the kind of thing Hans Zimmer used to do before Christopher Nolan introduced him to that “BWAAAAH” noise. It really helped sell every moment of this film.

So believe it or not, Michael Bay did it. He not only created a movie with the potential to change how people view the events of that night in Benghazi, but one that’s a legitimately good film in its own right. So 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a 5 on Ed Morrissey’s HotAir scale:

5 – Full price ticket

4 – Matinee only

3 – Wait for Blu-Ray/DVD/PPV rental or purchase

2 – Watch it when it hits Netflix/cable

1 – Avoid at all costs

It’s a powerful and compelling look at an important moment in recent history that’s absolutely worth a couple hours in a theater to know more about the unquestionable heroism displayed by men who were trapped in a hellish situation that was not only foreseeable, but entirely preventable.

I would also note that it earns its R rating for not shying away from showing the blood and guts at the end, so that’s something to be aware of it makes you squeamish.

13 Hours is rated R for strong combat violence throughout, bloody images, and language.

29,"Hours before they face off in a Democratic presidential primary debate, Sen. Bernard Sanders on Sunday accused Hillary Rodham Clinton of “sounding like a Republican” by attacking his Medicare-for-all plan.

Mr. Sanders, who now leads Mrs. Clinton in some Iowa and New Hampshire polls, said he’s disappointed his primary foe hasn’t come out in favor of a health care plan that would guarantee coverage for every single American. He said the Clinton campaign’s argument that his plan will raise health care costs for average Americans is wrong.

“Sometimes where the discussion becomes really absurd is that we will increase Medicare premiums, that is true. But we are doing away with all private health insurance premiums. And sometimes — and it disappoints me that the Clinton camp is kind of sounding like a Republican,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “The truth of the matter is, A) we spend far more per person on health care than any other nation. And second of all, a Medicare for all, single-payer program, would substantially, thousands of dollars a year, lower the cost of health insurance for the middle class of this country. So to say ‘Yes, there will be Medicare premiums,’ yes, of course there will. It’s not free. But we are doing away with all private health insurance costs.”

The spat comes as Mr. Sanders is under fire for his universal health care proposal, which the Clinton campaign says will require tax increases on middle-class families. Mr. Sanders has denied that charge and has said he will release the details of how he would pay for his plan before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.

But Mrs. Clinton has latched on to the issue and has said that, under a Sanders presidency, the Affordable Care Act — President Obama’s signature domestic achievement — would be undone.

“Well, first, I share the goal of universal health care … But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it, and to improve it,” she said on “This Week.” “The Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start over again in a contentious national debate, let’s do what I’m proposing, to get costs down, get out-of-pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs.”

30,"The men occupying Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge represent a bizarre contradiction. They howl about the overreach of the federal government, but they are among the biggest beneficiaries of government programs. For 150 years, their brand of logic has pitted individuals against an activist government, Western cowboys against black Americans, and the West against the East. Behind their protest is a uniquely American story that welds racism to anti-government sentiment. It comes from a peculiar coincidence of timing: that Reconstruction after the Civil War coincided with U.S. expansion into the American West.

Real “patriots,” the Bundys claim, stand against a behemoth government that has grasped their lands and their rights. America, after all, is made by ambitious individuals working their way up. A government that promotes social welfare or regulates business destroys the American system because it both limits a man’s ability to make money and requires tax revenue. Those taxes strike at the very heart of individualism because they redistribute money from hard workers to lazy people.

Ammon and Ryan Bundy and their compatriots are quite clear about exactly who those lazy people are. The younger Bundys’ father, Cliven, the Nevada rancher who started an armed standoff with government officials in 2014 over grazing rights, had plenty to say about the “Negro” who lived in government housing and “didn’t have nothing to do.” African-Americans’ laziness led them to abort their children and send their young men to jail. Bundy wondered: “are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life… or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.”

And yet, the Bundys are perfectly comfortably taking money from government programs themselves. Aside from animal kill programs that protect herds, drought relief payments, and the 93 percent discount at which the government assesses grazing fees, Ammon Bundy borrowed more than $500,000 from the federal government through a loan guarantee program for small businesses. Ammon Bundy’s father, Cliven, owes the government more than $1 million in grazing fees for running his cattle on public land. No matter how you slice it, taxpayers have subsidized the Bundys.

Observers have made much of this obvious contradiction. But it is not a sign only of the Bundys’ lack of self-awareness, or even simply of white supremacy. It is the intellectual formula that has driven American politics since 1980.

That formula was laid down immediately after the Civil War. In 1865, the South was so devastated by the war that Southerners, white and black, were starving. To provide rations and medical care, and to place homeless Southerners on farming land, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. To emphasize that government aid would be temporary, they placed what became known as the Freedmen’s Bureau within the War Department. In summer 1865, military officers distributed 150,000 rations, a third of them to white people. But the agents also took on an unexpected role. Southern states refused to let ex-slaves testify in court, leaving them to the tender mercies of angry white Southerners, who cheated, beat, raped and murdered them. So Freedmen’s Bureau officers began to hear the cases that pitted black and white Southerners against each other.

While agents often forced black people back to work for abusive employers or demanded subservient behavior, they decided cases in favor of ex-slaves about 68 percent of the time. So Southern Democrats rewrote history. They had not fought the Civil War over slavery after all, they insisted. They had fought it to stop a huge government bureaucracy from forcing its way into their homes and regulating the way they treated “their people.” They had fought, they now claimed, not for slavery, but for states' rights.

When Congress tried to expand the Freedmen’s Bureau the following year to enable it to provide education for poor Americans of all races, President Andrew Johnson added the final ideological piece to the Democrats’ attack on an activist government. That piece was taxation. During the war, the Republican Congress had created the nation’s first national taxes, including the income tax. Johnson vetoed the bill expanding the Freedmen’s Bureau on two grounds. First, although the schools in the bill would have disproportionately helped whites in the border states, Johnson claimed that it provided benefits for African-Americans that had never been accorded to white people. Second, he explained that the bill would create an army of officials that would harass Southern whites, while the taxes necessary to support them would impoverish hardworking white people.

This formula—that an activist government sucks white tax dollars to provide for lazy minorities—has been sold to voters ever since.

It caught on largely because of the odd happenstance that it coincided with the rise of the American cowboy. During this very moment, the cattle industry was taking off on the Western plains. Cowboys tended to be former Confederates who were dirt poor and good with a horse and a gun. Their dirty, hard, ill-paid and dangerous lives mirrored those of Eastern industrial workers, but Southern Democratic newspaper editors grabbed hold of the idea of the free and independent cowboy as the embodiment of American individualism. Cowboys, they said, were the very opposite of the ex-slaves the government was coddling. Cowboys were hardworking young men who asked nothing of the government.

The reality, of course, was that the cattle industry depended almost entirely on the American government. The Army protected herds and cattlemen against Indians, Congress funded the railroads that moved cattle to Eastern markets, and Indian agents bought cattle to fulfill the ration provisions of treaties. Cattlemen, in short, received massive government subsidies. But the image of the Western cowboy as a hardworking man who asked only to be left alone got traction among Southerners and Northern Democrats who hated the idea of black rights, and who loathed the Republicans’ activist government that was trying to enforce those rights.

By the 1870s, ex-Confederates had taken their support for Western individualism a step further. They insisted the federal government was actively persecuting Western individuals. Their hero was Jesse James, the former Confederate guerilla-turned-criminal. When a Republican state government in Missouri refused to let ex-Confederates sit on juries or practice law, Democrats used the fugitive James to bludgeon their political opponents. James was “an angel of light,” as one said, who wanted to turn himself in to authorities, but could not because he would not get a fair trial in a courtroom full of his political opponents. He was a good man, the story went, but the government was forcing him into criminality. And then, the governor of Missouri cut a deal with Robert Ford to kill James. That a government official had colluded to murder a citizen added fuel to the idea that Westerners were in danger from an overweening government.

The political construct that lionized Western individuals and demonized an activist government, a government that apparently helped minorities, was a product of a peculiar moment in American history. Neither the moment nor the ideology lasted. The political construct that idealized cowboys fell into disrepute during and immediately after the New Deal. In those years, Americans turned away from Western individualism and toward the idea of an activist government. Westerners and Southerners both, after all, were suffering from the Dust Bowl and the boll weevil. They wanted government programs even more than Easterners did. But in the 1950s, the Movement Conservative war on the New Deal resurrected the post-Civil War political cliché.

Since the Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954, Movement Conservatives have tapped into the idea that an activist government redistributed wealth to lazy minorities. But they have also pushed hard on the idea that true Americans are Western individualists. Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater launched this association in 1964 by dismissing Brown v. Board as governmental overreach and fictionalizing his wealthy upbringing as a hardscrabble Western frontier story; Ronald Reagan made it even more explicit by contrasting his image of the Welfare Queen with his own cowboy hat and Western ranch. And yet, the Goldwater and the Reagan stories mirrored those of the historical Western individual: their regions, and their own families, prospered only when government contracts poured money into their communities. To them, there was no contradiction between their championing of individualism and benefiting from government largess.

According to Movement Conservatives, Americans who believe in individualism want nothing from the government, and thus, unlike grasping minorities, they are the nation’s true patriots. The government should do nothing for ""lazy black Americans,"" who only want an un-American redistribution of wealth through taxes. But, paradoxically, the government can—and should—use tax money to help America’s individualists.

This is the peculiar contradiction that defines today’s politics.

Confederates, cowboys, anti-government diatribes from people who are prime beneficiaries of government programs … thanks to the Bundys we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Reconstruction by reliving it.

31,"Jeb Bush based on the best case scenario is floundering like a fish out of water. Trying his best to make it back into the pond with the big fish (Trump, Cruz and Rubio) but unable to even get back near the shore. In fact he is set to hit the grill.

According to an upper level campaign insider if bush fails to place in the top three in both Iowa and New Hampshire, his largest donors have let him know they will be moving on to greener pastures. Current Iowa polls show him having no chance of placing in the top three in Iowa which if his large campaign donors stick to their uns will end his campaign. According to ElectLeaders.com polling Jeb comes of as Entitled, Arrogant, Low Energy, Insider, with all of those obtaining over 40% in our poll.

Here is the latest poll we have done completed 01/13/2016 at 8 PM has him in 6th place trailing even Rand Paul who was not invited to the big kids table for the Fox News Debate. Hopefully this truly turns out the light on this poor campaign full of entitlement.

33,"When his poll numbers first started ticking upwards in the spring of last year, many reporters were tempted by the narrative of a Sanders surge, but those temptations were often tempered by a sense that Clinton’s lead was impossibly large, and that Sanders would simply use his growing popularity among young Democratic voters to push her leftward, before exiting the race.

By the end of the summer it was clear that Sanders had reached striking distance, and it had thus become impossible to treat his campaign as a largely symbolic affair. Yet, no sooner had this air of seriousness overtaken his candidacy than Clinton seemed to reassert her dominance. In October, she won the first Democratic debate, she (probably) intimidated Vice President Joe Biden out of entering the race against his own wishes, and she humiliated the snarling Republican members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi over twelve hours of testimony. As her lead widened, Sanders seemed to accept her inevitability. He treated her with unexpected deference in debates, and stayed conspicuously quiet about her in general, until an explosive altercation with the DNC over his campaign’s access to the committee’s voter files lent his campaign new vivaciousness. His re-energized outfit is now either gaining on Clinton, or expanding his lead, in national and early-state primary polls.

If Sanders’s surge continues apace, he will win in Iowa, win in New Hampshire, and quickly be vying for 50 percent of the national Democratic vote.

Conventional wisdom continues to suggest that Iowa and New Hampshire, where the Democratic electorates are unusually white, combine to create a false impression of Sanders’s strength—that he will falter once he and Clinton begin competing in the more ethnically diverse states of the South and interior West. If the past year proves anything, though, it’s that skepticism of the conventional wisdom is urgently in order.

Even Clinton seems to be questioning it. Her campaign’s oddly framed attacks on Sanders’s single payer advocacy connote an urgent desire to blunt his momentum. And yet, Sanders himself still seems shaped by the idea that he was never supposed to get this far. His ads, the way he parries with Clinton in general, convey an ambivalence about his own strength that make it hard to imagine him pressing his advantages and making Clinton work for delegates she’s probably taking for granted.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/41e2b8/bernie_sanders_can_win_when_will_he_believe_that/,newrepublic.com
34,"There were no votes cast, no startling changes in polls, no fatal gaffes. Yet last week brought something new and crucial to the often-chaotic presidential campaign: clarity.

On national security and the fight against radical Islam, assumed differences were flushed into the open between President Obama and the Republican field. For Democrats, clarity comes with the evidence that Hillary Clinton is having serious trouble making the sale.

The week started with a petulant Obama using a State of the Union lecture to come clean about his ­casual view of terrorism. After years of failing to persuade Americans he is serious about combating jihadists, we now know why: He confessed that he’s not all that worried about Islamic State or any other terror group.

He scoffed at “over-the-top claims that this is World War III” and insisted that “masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages . . . do not threaten our national existence.”

The too-cool view revealed that he hasn’t moved very far from the time two years ago when he called Islamic State the “JV team.” It was a mistake then, as bloodcurdling events proved, and it is almost pathological that he still downplays the global reach of the group and its goal of launching mass attacks against America and our allies.

By his calculations, we should save our concern until the terror group has the ability to destroy us. That is an extremely foolish approach because waiting until then could be too late, not to mention all the innocent blood that will be shed in the meantime.

Still, at least we have clarity about how he really feels.

Fortunately, Thursday’s GOP ­debate showed without doubt that, despite other fault lines among them, the seven major candidates are united in their conviction that Obama is dead wrong. The contenders took turns blasting Obama’s failure to even acknowledge the role of Islam, and promised to destroy Islamic State instead of merely trying to contain it.

Sen. Marco Rubio provided the most electrifying version of the juxtaposition when he said of the terror army: “The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where they are; the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them; and if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.”

That’s a difference with a distinction!

The Fox Business debate also provided clarity on the race two weeks before the Iowa caucus by showing why there are only three real contenders: Donald Trump’s muscular performance reflected his big lead nationally and in New Hampshire, while Sen. Ted Cruz was scrappy and focused in trying to protect his slim margin in Iowa. Only Rubio is consistently within striking distance of both, and is most likely to rise if the Trump-Cruz showdown leaves just one them standing.

The emerging clarity on the Democratic side comes with a twist. The dead heat in Iowa between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders adds to the belief that Clinton is going backward. She’s behind in New Hampshire, and her team is touting a “firewall” in the South, suggesting they are lowering public expectations and their own goals for the first two tests.

The problems for Clinton are not new, but they are intensifying. The FBI investigation into her handling of classified information reportedly expanded to include whether corporations that contributed to the Clinton Foundation got favors from her State Department.

I’ve always believed that was the mother lode of scandal, with hundreds of millions of dollars ending up in the foundation or in the Clintons’ personal pockets. The amounts are so large, and the timing of some payments so suspicious, that it defies belief that all of them were kosher. The river of cash deserves serious law-enforcement scrutiny.

Coming on top of the widespread doubts about Clinton’s integrity and the greater enthusiasm among Sanders’ supporters, the FBI probe has the potential to fatally wound her. Even the stock-market chaos and economic slowdown work against her because of her long ties to Wall Street, and because of Sanders’ socialist screeds. Although the RealClearPolitics average of national polls has her ahead by nearly 9 points, a Sanders win in both Iowa and New Hampshire would shatter any sense of inevitability.

Indeed, Hillary already is rattled enough that she sent daughter Chelsea out on the stump to level false charges against Sanders’ health-care plans. The move had stunned Dems asking whether the Clinton campaign already is in full panic mode.

The answer is yes, and for good reason. Clarity means everyone can see that she’s in trouble.

Give NY the gift of an honest government

If Gov. Cuomo and legislators are serious about tackling corruption, they could follow the lead of the city’s ethics rules. As The Post reports, seven city firefighters were fined up to $4,000 each for accepting free tickets from the NFL to last year’s Super Bowl. The tickets violated the $50 limit on gifts that employees can take from anyone doing business with the city.

It’s a draconian rule, but if it’s good enough for civil servants, it should be good enough for their political masters. So I propose that Cuomo and lawmakers vote to live within the $50 limit — and also apply it to political donations.

Bye-bye, million-dollar backers. Hello, honest government.

Taxis running a ‘read’ light

The City Council bill that guts English requirements for cabdrivers is an example of lousy government at work.

Instead of showing they can read and write English — traffic signs, for example — cabbies would only need to pass an oral exam.

Fuming riders were wrong to assume that City Hall serves them. In truth, the bill aims to fatten the coffers of cab owners, at the expense of safety and common sense.

Arrogant reign of King Putz

It’s good to be king. Just ask Bill de Blasio.

Reacting to criticism from the principals union about how he is running the schools, The Putz responded with a royal swagger.

“If anyone says they would prefer the previous administration’s model, well, they should have voted for that,” the mayor said. “We have a different vision.”

The sneering smackdown recalls how President Obama rudely silenced Republican critics by declaring that “the election is over.”

Both men are afflicted with the mistaken impression that elections are blank checks and that winning confers unlimited power to do whatever they want, the public be damned.

In fact, political capital has to be carefully nurtured and expanded, so it’s available for emergencies and important decisions. Wasting your cache on unpopular policies and arrogant reactions to legitimate criticism is a recipe for public anger and polarization.

To see the proof, de Blasio only need look at Obama’s low standing among most Americans. Our DNA doesn’t tolerate kings.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/41di6j/a_crucial_moment_of_clarity_in_the_presidential/,nypost.com
35,"FOR those of us who argue in favor of gun safety laws, there are a few inconvenient facts.

We liberals are sometimes glib about equating guns and danger. In fact, it’s complicated: The number of guns in America has increased by more than 50 percent since 1993, and in that same period the gun homicide rate in the United States has dropped by half.

Then there are the policies that liberals fought for, starting with the assault weapons ban. A 113-page study found no clear indication that it reduced shooting deaths for the 10 years it was in effect. That’s because the ban was poorly drafted, and because even before the ban, assault weapons accounted for only 2 percent of guns used in crimes.

Move on to open-carry and conceal-carry laws: With some 13 million Americans now licensed to pack a concealed gun, many liberals expected gun battles to be erupting all around us. In fact, the most rigorous analysis suggests that all these gun permits caused neither a drop in crime (as conservatives had predicted) nor a spike in killings (as liberals had expected). Liberals were closer to the truth, for the increase in carrying loaded guns does appear to have led to more aggravated assaults with guns, but the fears were overblown.

One of the puzzles of American politics is that most voters want gun regulation, but Congress resists. One poll found that 74 percent even of N.R.A. members favor universal background checks to acquire a gun. Likewise, the latest New York Times poll found that 62 percent of Americans approved of President Obama’s executive actions on guns this month.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/41e1i3/some_inconvenient_gun_facts_for_liberals/,nytimes.com
36,"An underappreciated fact about U.S. Constitutional law is that it recognizes sources of authority prior to the U.S. Constitution itself. It is settled law that the Bill of Rights, in particular, does not confer rights, it only recognizes “natural rights” which pre-exist the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and which – this is the key point – cannot be abolished by amending the Constitution.

What is the nature of these “natural rights”? The Founding Fathers of the U.S. spoke of them as an endowment by the Creator in the Declaration of Independence. This is, in modern terms, a much less religious statement than meets the eye. At the time the Declaration was written, many forward-thinking intellectuals (influenced by a now-largely-extinct movement called Deism) used the terms “God” and “Natural Law” almost interchangeably. (I have written before about how later waves of religious revival have obscured this point.)

In modern terms, we can think of “natural rights” as the political and social rules which are required to sustain “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”, and derive them not from religion but from game-theoretic analysis of the behavior of competing agents in a political system.

The theorists of English Republicanism in the century and a half before the Declaration of Independence did not have the language of economics or game theory, but they developed a pretty firm grasp on the theory of natural rights by studying the historical failure modes of various political systems.

The English Republican defenses of (for example) the right to free speech were very simple: if these are not the rules of your polity, your polity will come to a bad end in tyranny and chaos and great suffering. In modern terms, they were seeking stable cooperative equilibria under the recognition that most possible sets of political rules do not yield it.

This was the thinking behind the U.S. Constitution, in general, and the Bill of Rights in particular. Because natural rights are a consequence of natural law, no law can abrogate them. Laws which intend to abrogate them are contrary to the purpose of law itself, which is to sustain a stable cooperative equilibrium in which humans can flourish, and therefore no one is bound to obey them.

This is written into black-letter law in the U.S. about even the most contentious of the ten articles of the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment. In United States v. Cruikshank , 92 U. S. 542, 553 (1876), the Supreme Court said of the individual right to bear arms “[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.” This language was quoted and reaffirmed in the 2008 Heller vs. D.C. decision .

Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. This is English Republicanism’s theory of natural rights limiting not merely what the law can do, but what amendments to the Constitution can do. The right to bear arms (and the right to free speech, and the other rights recognized by the first ten amendments) are not conditional; they are not grants made by law, government, or the Constitution that can be withdrawn by amending these institutions. They are prior to all this apparatus.

Switching back to a game-theoretical perspective, we can to some extent discover the meaning and extent of these rights by investigating their consequences. We can ask of rival interpretations of edge cases around these rights whether they support or hinder stable cooperative equilibrium. What we cannot do is pretend that the broad thrust of these rights is negotiable without fundamentally repudiating the entirety of the American system clear back to the Constitution and its pre-Constitutional foundations.

This has mainly been an essay about the meaning of “natural rights” and the relationship between law, philosophy, and the Constitution. But I mean to give it teeth by addressing one current political issue: could the First or Second Amendments be, in any meaningful sense, repealed? Can any legal or Constitutional process abolish the individual rights to free speech and to bear arms?

It should be clear from the foregoing that the answer is “no”. Amendment of the Constitution cannot abolish a right that was not granted by the Constitution in the first place. People who fail to grasp this understand neither the law, nor the Constitution, nor the Constitution’s ethical foundations.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/41dhkc/what_amending_the_constitution_cannot_do/,esr.ibiblio.org
37,"Email a copy of ""America’s Sorry State"" to a friend

A few hours before US President Barack Obama delivered his last State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, American sailors were captured and detained at sea by the Iranian navy.

Literally forced to their knees, nine men and one woman were held until the following day, when Tehran decided to release them, after determining that their boats’ GPS had led them astray. Had the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy reached a different conclusion, the US “Marines,” as Iran referred to them, would have met a far more unpleasant fate.

While still under Islamic interrogation on the floor of an Iranian vessel, the 10 Americans were unable to listen to Obama’s speech to the nation from the podium of Congress.

This is just as well.

The last thing you’d want in such a situation is to hear the commander-in-chief of your armed forces not even mention it when the topic of Iran came up. Indeed, not even refer to it at all.

What rang loud and clear to the rest of the world who actually watched the speech on television — particularly the ayatollahs — was the president’s utter capitulation to the literal and figurative hostage-takers in the Middle East.

It began with four rhetorical questions he raised about the future, the third of which was: “How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?”

Since the second part of the query has been the foreign policy of his administration from the get-go, Obama should have learned by now that the first part is unachievable when one’s goal is to abdicate moral and military authority.

But since this president, who very shortly after taking the helm announced he would be “leading from behind,” has never genuinely put the security of America or the rest of the free world at the top of his agenda, the words caused him no pause when they appeared on his teleprompter.

No, for Obama, the temperature of the planet has been of greater concern than the climate of jihad that has led to storm after tsunami of death and destruction everywhere the eye can see. And since wreaths placed on sidewalk memorials for freshly slaughtered innocent people are bio-degradable, it’s all good.

So good, in fact, that this weekend the sanctions imposed on Iran’s nuclear program are about to be lifted, after the International Atomic Energy Agency gives the green light.

About this travesty Obama had only positive things to say. After paying lip service to the danger posed to civilians by “fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages,” who “do not threaten our national existence,” the president took credit for having “built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.”

Yes, he said, “As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war.”

The applause Obama barely received during his hour-long ramble was faint enough to enable the louder sound of guffawing from Tehran to drown it out.

Or maybe it was not laughter we were hearing, but rather the clicks of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s calculator counting the multi-billions of dollars he is about to receive in unlocked frozen accounts. You know, as soon as the IAEA reports that Iran has fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear accord it supposedly signed in July with the P5+1.

Never mind that the Iranian military has been flexing its ballistic-missile muscles and threatening the US warships in the Strait of Hormuz, while still calling for “death to America, the Great Satan.”

No matter that Iran nabbed and grabbed American sailors, forcing the female among them to wear a hijab so as not to offend radical Muslim male sensibilities.

As the crew remained in custody while Obama patted himself on the back for the nuclear deal, the White House said, “We do not see this as hostile intent.”

Such is the state of the nation that Obama has helped its enemies demean — a country that should cause Third World despots to cower, not taunt, ridicule and threaten.

Hillary Clinton on Sunday invoked the June murder of nine people at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, to attack Bernie Sanders’ record on gun cuntrol ahead of Sunday night’s Democratic presidential debate there.

The former secretary of state said the Vermont senator should change his position after voting for a provision that lets someone buy a gun if the background check takes longer than three days to complete — which she called the “Charleston loophole” because it’s how shooter Dylann Roof acquired his weapon.

Story Continued Below

Sanders has now backed away from his vote to give gunmakers and sellers legal immunity, Clinton said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“I welcome Sen. Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on,” Clinton said, “I hope he will continue to move.”

Sanders, appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said Clinton is attacking him because of his campaign’s momentum.

The immunity provision, he said, was part of a 1988 assault weapons ban that he voted for because it prohibited armor-piercing bullets. He acknowledged he wants to reopen the issue, as well as the waiting period, but he did not commit to a number of days.

“I hope we don’t have to politicize that issue,” Sanders said of the Charleston shooting. “We are willing to look at anything that makes sense that keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. But I’m not going to be defensive on that issue.”

Back on “This Week,"" Clinton was shown a new ad in Iowa from American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove, that says she rewarded Wall Street campaign contributions with a $700 billion bailout. Clinton said she hadn’t seen the ad but found it, in a “perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety.”

“They know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans,” she said. “I didn’t know about Karl Rove’s ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he’s trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on the way to caucus for me.”

Clinton said she has “stood up to Wall Street” and “advocated for changes” even though she represented New York as a senator.

A Sanders ad criticizing Democrats who took contributions from the financial industry would also implicate President Barack Obama and former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), but that didn't stop them from pushing tough new regulations, she said.

“That is just a false charge,” she said.

Clinton also cheered the prisoner swap with Iran that brought U.S. prisoners home at about the same time that inspectors confirmed that Iran is complying with the agreement to dismantle its nuclear program.

“This is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama,” she said. “The fact [that] we put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news.”",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/41e24b/clinton_attacks_sanders_gun_record_ahead_of/,politico.com

42,"Rush Limbaugh, nationally syndicated conservative radio show host, during the Tuesday broadcast of his show, accused the “Washington establishment” of plotting a “silent coup” in order to oust President Donald Trump.

Limbaugh, discussing Trump’s presidency, claimed that ever since Trump was elected, the established Washington power players “began to circle the wagons,” and from that day forward, Trump was not going to be “allowed to triumph on anything.”

Intimating that success would be by a very narrow margin — if at all — Limbaugh added, “There was no way that this establishment was going to permit an outsider to come in and clean house and show how Washington can work and blow their cover for the last how many decades.”

Limbaugh noted that it doesn’t necessarily mean that a draining of the swamp can’t be done, but that the Washington elite “weren’t going to help this along.”

“They were not going to contribute,” he added. “They were not going to make this easy for Trump.”

The radio host even went as far as to say that the election of Trump “has never been about” the president “unifying the Republican party in order to beat the Democrats.”

“That’s been the mistake,” Limbaugh said. “That’s not the fight here. The fight is Donald Trump and his cadre and you, the Trump base, versus the Washington establishment. It has always been that and nothing more.”

Later during the airing, Limbaugh doubled down on remarks that something nefarious is afoot within the “Washington establishment.”

“We’re in the midst of a silent coup,” he said. “These people are trying to take this president out. And everybody understands that. So why in that circumstance do you think that the same people trying to destroy Donald Trump are going to help him get rid of Obamacare? Are going to help him reform the tax code? They’re not. They are going to have to be defeated, not worked with. There isn’t any cooperation.”

""This legislation threatens our ability to attract and retain the best talent in Texas, as well as the greatest sporting and cultural attractions in the world,"" they wrote.

Around 80 business execs gathered at the Capitol on Monday to protest the bill. ""On this discussion, conservatives can disagree with conservatives,"" Jeff Moseley, the head of the Texas Association of Business, told reporters at the scene, saying it's important to protect the ""Texas miracle."" Execs from tech companies including Apple and Google urged Abbott to reject the measure to restrict bathroom use for transgender people when it was before the legislature in May. It didn't pass during the regular legislative session, but the controversy returned when Abbott made the issue, a conservative priority, part of the agenda for a 30-day special legislative session that began Monday, the Texas Tribune reports.

44,"A Berkeley High School art teacher’s latest canvas is a license plate.

Miriam Klein Stahl, well-known for illustrating the best-selling Rad Women books, is one of three artists whose designs promoting reproductive rights could appear on special California license plates, if a bill from state Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson becomes law. Only one of the artists’ designs will make the cut, and Californians can vote online for their favorites. The other artists in the competition are Mimi Pond and Juana Alicia.

Already passed by the senate, Jackson’s SB 309 would direct the Department of Motor Vehicles to offer decorated plates that say “California Trusts Women,” as long as 7,500 motorists order them. Proceeds from the sales of the plates — which would cost $50 to purchase and $40 to renew —would support the state’s Family Planning, Access Care and Treatment program for low-income residents.

“SB 309 will provide a way for Californians who are deeply troubled by the federal attack on women’s rights and health care to take their values ‘to the street’ while providing a vital funding mechanism for California’s network of reproductive health care providers,” said Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara, in a press release.

Pro-choice organization NARAL, which is sponsoring the bill, commissioned possible plate designs from three California artists, including Stahl.

“We went to our community and connections, and looked at people who we thought were great artists and thought would be interested in lending their voice to the cause,” said Rebecca Griffin, NARAL’s associate director of California programs.

Stahl, who teaches in BHS’s Arts and Humanities Academy, did not have to think hard about participating in the project when NARAL approached her in the spring.

“Especially in these times, when abortion clinics and women’s health are so under attack nationwide, for California to make such a bold act as to put it on cars driving around, I thought, ‘I totally want to be a part of that,'” she said.

Her submission is an image of two female protesters holding a sign that says “Trust Women” against a bright yellow background.

“It’s quite a design challenge to represent a woman’s right to choose on a license plate,” Stahl said.

The design she came up with is a riff on the original cover of the reproductive health bible Our Bodies, Ourselves. Stahl’s daughter is related to one of the authors, so the book has always been an important one in their family, she said.

Voting will be open until the end of July and possibly through August or September, Griffin said. A vote on the license plate design signs one up as a member of NARAL, but there are no required costs or other associated obligations, she said.

With this potential law, California could become just the second state to offer a pro-choice specialty plate, after Virginia. (The state program the plates would support does not cover abortions, but the messaging around the initiative is pro-choice.) Twenty-nine states currently offer “Choose Life” license plates, many of which support anti-abortion programs.

California already offers several other special interest plates, including those supporting environmental causes and law enforcement.

While she waits to hear the outcome of the vote, Stahl is staying busy with other projects this summer. She is finishing up illustrations for My Rad Life: A Journal, due out in August from Ten Speed Press. The journal, written by Kate Schatz, who worked with Stahl on the other Rad books, will include writing and doodling prompts and feature some of the female leaders and activists who appear in their other work.

46,"Two House Republicans are actively working to torpedo President Trump’s effort to separate air traffic control from the federal government, which would deliver a major blow to one of the administration’s chief infrastructure priorities.

Reps. Steve Russell (R-Okla.) and Ralph Abraham (R-La.), who say they agree with Trump about the need to modernize the country’s air navigation system, told The Hill on Tuesday that they have been explaining their concerns over the spinoff plan to colleagues, pointing out contentious bill language and trying to move skeptical GOP lawmakers into the “no” column.

House leadership began whipping members last Thursday on a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which includes the privatization plan endorsed by Trump. A similar effort stalled last year amid opposition from both parties and was never brought to the House floor.

Similarly, GOP leaders are unlikely to bring it up this year unless they are confident it has enough votes to pass. A vote has not yet been scheduled, though amendments were due Monday.

“They were going to try to run it this week,” Russell said in a joint interview with Abraham in the Speaker’s lobby. “We were able to raise enough concern, just by showing [other lawmakers] language in the bill, that when they whipped the bill, they did not have enough votes to put it on the floor.”

It’s unclear how many Republicans oppose the plan at this point. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), an appropriator, and Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, are among those who have publicly come out against the idea.

Russell said he and Abraham have been lobbying colleagues to vote against the measure during in-office visits and vote series.

“We’ve not tried to unleash any midnight surprise. We’ve been very open and out front on where our positions were,” he said. “We tried to raise these concerns weeks ago. We had asked for a pause to address some of our issues. We asked the chairman, we asked leadership.”

“While they are appreciative and understand our concerns, they said, ‘We’re going to move on,’ ” he added.

Proponents of the spinoff proposal, meanwhile, are also scrambling to bring lawmakers to their side.

Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) has been trying to whip up support during vote series; his office has been blasting out “dear colleague” letters and fact sheets about the plan. Rep. Sam Graves Samuel (Sam) Bruce GravesHouse passes bipartisan water infrastructure bill Lawmakers left with more questions than answers on Trump infrastructure plan Five obstacles to Trump's infrastructure ambitions MORE (R-Mo.), a pilot, has been trying to assuage lawmakers worried about protecting the general aviation (GA) community.

The White House has also been doing outreach on Capitol Hill, which has involved making phone calls and sending high-ranking officials to sell wary members on the proposal.

Lawmakers are up against the clock, as the FAA’s legal authority expires at the end of September and the House is scheduled to leave town for the August recess at the end of next week.

There is a lot at stake for supporters of the spinoff plan.

If the full House votes on the legislation, it will be the first time that the majority of the chamber will be going on the record on the issue. A strong vote could send a clear message to the Senate, where lawmakers are moving ahead without the spinoff plan.

But a failure to bring the measure to the floor could doom the effort this year. The lower chamber is seen as Trump’s best shot for passing the proposal, as the Senate has remained largely opposed to the idea.

There is a broad range of opposition to the proposal, which would transfer the country’s air navigation system to a private, nonprofit corporation governed by a board of directors while keeping the FAA in charge of safety oversight.

Supporters say it will help speed up long-stalled modernization efforts at the agency, which still uses paper strips to track flights in some towers.

Abraham's main concern is that general aviation users and small airports could lose access to the airspace, face higher fees or be inadequately represented under the spinoff model.

Graves, who voted against the proposal last year, worked with Shuster on legislative changes designed to better support the GA community, such as exempting all GA users from the new entity’s fees and ensuring a more diverse makeup on the board.

But Abraham said there was no guarantee that board members would vote to protect GA interests.

“They did a little, but not enough to really matter,” Abraham said. “This is the taxpayers' airspace. We’re going to take that away and give it to a private corporation?”

Russell, who has a military background, said he maintains serious national security concerns about putting a nongovernmental agency in charge of air traffic control and removing it from congressional oversight.

“There are a few things that you would never let go: national defense, national intelligence and our national air space,” he said.

But Shuster’s office has emphasized that the federal government would still maintain responsibility over those areas and pointed out that Defense Secretary James Mattis has even supported the effort.

47,"President Donald Trump intends to formally nominate former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Jr. as ambassador to Russia, the White House announced on Tuesday.

Huntsman, who ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, previously served as U.S. ambassador to China and to Singapore.

He is currently serving as the chairman of both the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank, and the Huntsman Cancer Foundation.

HUNTSMAN TO BE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR

Huntsman was elected governor of Utah in 2004 and re-elected four years later. He resigned seven months into his second term to become ambassador to China under the Obama administration.

He resigned to launch his 2012 presidential campaign but wound up dropping out of the race after finishing third in the New Hampshire primary.

48,"Business and the economy

Given all that Donald Trump promised the business world during his bombastic campaign, it’s tempting to dismiss the president’s first six months with a “meh”. It would also be myopic.

While protesters are worried about the future, the president has so far failed to pass his tax reforms, which business wanted. But at the same time fears that his China rhetoric, threats of trade wars and tweets about penalties for US businesses who ship jobs overseas, have not amounted to much.

The economic trends started under Obama have continued: stock markets have continued their giddy ride to uncharted highs, unemployment has continued to drift down and interest rates have remained low.

Trump’s overture may seem a little weak, but the president has already made significant moves and still more may be happening in the wings.

Trump has ordered a review of Dodd-Frank, the regulations brought in to tame US financial institutions after they triggered the worst recession in living memory. He has appointed a sworn enemy of net neutrality over at the Federal Communications Commission, who is now working to dismantle Obama-era open internet protections. He has freed up energy firms to start polluting rivers again and scrapped a rule that barred companies from receiving federal contracts if they had a history of violating wage, labour or safety laws.

After years of gains for consumer, environmental and worker rights groups, the pendulum is being swung the other way – but most often those changes are happening behind closed doors.

In March, Trump pledged to “remove every job-killing regulation we can find” and deregulation teams have been set up to comb through the statutes looking for rules to cull. A recent ProPublica and New York Times investigation found Trump’s deregulation teams were being conducted in the dark in large part by appointees with deep industry ties and potential conflicts of interest.

It’s hardly surprising given that the Trump administration has literally removed the White House visitors book, so we may never know who has been whispering in the president’s ear. Six months in, it is hard to tell what is being cut and by whom. We may never know the consequences of Trump’s regulation death squads until it’s too late. Dominic Rushe

The environment

In the past week, both Emmanuel Macron and Sir Richard Branson have claimed that Donald Trump has been gripped by regret over his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. But hopes that the US president will reverse this decision sit uneasily with the consistency of his administration’s environmental rollbacks.

In Scott Pruitt, Trump has an Environmental Protection Agency chief who understands how the agency works and how to hobble it. Pruitt, who has dismissed the mainstream scientific understanding of climate change, has spearheaded a concerted effort to excise or delay dozens of environmental rules.

Emissions standards for cars and trucks, the clean power plan, water pollution restrictions, a proposed ban on a pesticide linked to developmental problems in children, regulations that stop power plants dumping toxins such as mercury into their surrounds – all have been targeted with efficacious zeal by Pruitt.

The EPA administrator was also a fierce proponent of a US exit from the Paris accord, ensuring that Trump wasn’t swayed by doubts raised by Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Ivanka Trump, his daughter and adviser. The US won’t be able to officially pull out until 2020, but the decision has dealt a hefty blow to the effort to slow dangerous global warming and provided a tangible victory for the nationalist, climate change denying elements that now roam the White House.

Elsewhere, public land has been thrown open to coal mining – an industry repeatedly fetishized by Trump – and oil and gas drilling is being ushered into America’s Arctic and Atlantic waters. Two dozen national monuments are under review, several may be shrunk or even eliminated.

In less than six months, Trump has begun to tear up almost all of the key planks of Barack Obama’s environmental agenda. This blitzkrieg is likely to slow now that it faces a thicket of legal action launched by enraged environmental groups and some states, such as New York. But to Trump’s supporters, the president, who pledged during the campaign to reduce the EPA to “tidbits”, is delivering on his crusade to transport the environmental and industrial outlook of the late 19th century to the modern day.

Immigration

Donald Trump’s bluster over his harsh immigration reform – namely the implementation of a diluted Muslim-targeted travel ban and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants – belies the cost these self-proclaimed victories have had on both the fundamental institutions of democracy and the most vulnerable communities in the United States.

Take the travel ban, which targets refugees and visa applicants from six Muslim majority countries. The president’s first failed order, haphazardly issued in January, provoked scenes of chaos at airports around the country – temporarily separating families, cancelling legitimately issued visas and propelling the country toward a constitutional crisis, before a series of federal courts intervened to block it.

After his second attempt in March was blocked again in the lower courts, the president, seemingly without care for due process or respect for the co-equal branches of government, threatened to simply abolish the federal appeals court he incorrectly identified as responsible for the decision.

'I have the right to be here': becoming an American under a Trump presidency Read more

Trump’s bullish perseverance on the ban, which has left many in Muslim and refugee communities around the US living in fear, has resulted in a temporary ruling in the supreme court that allows a much diluted version of the order to come into effect. Although the president heralded the decision a victory, the ultimate test comes in autumn when the country’s highest court will ultimately rule on the ban’s constitutionality.

The president has also moved quickly to supercharge efforts to round up and deport undocumented immigrants. By empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency responsible deportations, to target essentially anyone in the country without legal paperwork, the number of immigration arrests has soared. Although the administration has celebrated this uptick, it has actually been able to deport people at a much slower rate due to the crippling backlog inside America’s immigration courts.

Trump’s attempt at a solution to this has been to create a network of new courts, attached to remote detention centers and far from the reach of immigration attorneys. The strategy, plagued with due process concerns, has enjoyed mixed success. But, once again, it is those most vulnerable – many of whom have lived in America without paperwork for decades and have no criminal history – who have paid the highest price. Oliver Laughland

Diplomacy

First, the good news. Donald Trump has not started a war. He has therefore, so far, avoided the worst-case scenario that some predicted for his presidency. One-eighth of the way through his term, he does not yet have a stain on his record like George W Bush has with Iraq. Instead his Twitter spats with cable TV hosts and their indulgence by the media are a luxury of peacetime.

But in other, important ways, the US president has set about diminishing America’s global leadership role and diplomatic standing. He has emphasised the defence of America and western civilisation and downplayed democracy and human rights. He has warmed to authoritarian leaders in China, the Philippines, Russia and Saudi Arabia while going cold on Britain (still no visit), the European Union and Australia. His attacks on the press send an alarming message to dictators everywhere.

The world has noticed. A major survey of 37 countries by Pew Research last month found that just 22% of respondents had some or a great deal of confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. After his performance at Nato and G7 meetings, German chancellor Angela Merkel said pointedly: “The times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over. I’ve experienced that in the last few days. We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands.” At the G20, he cut a lonely, isolated figure.

This damage could be undone relatively quickly but the “America first” president’s proposed 30% cut to the state department, where many top staff have left and not been replaced, threatens to be a lasting legacy. Max Bergmann, a former official, wrote in Politico: “The deconstruction of the state department is well underway ... This is how diplomacy dies. Not with a bang, but with a whimper. With empty offices on a midweek afternoon.”

The outlier in Trump’s foreign policy came on 6 April, when the US launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at an airfield in Syria in retaliation for the regime’s use of chemical weapons against civilians. It was a move welcomed by hawks and loathed by “anti-globalists” in Trump’s support base. But the most urgent issue, enough to test any US president, is North Korea. There is little evidence so far to suggest he will succeed where others have failed. David Smith

Gender and equality

Trump’s White House has wasted little time erasing many of the changes that advocates for trans rights, reproductive rights and survivors of sexual assault achieved under the Obama administration.

The Trump team is in the middle of sharply reversing how the federal government enforces laws against gender bias. In February, the administration withdrew the Obama-era guidelines requiring schools to give transgender students unfettered access to bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity. And Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, may restrict the federal government’s ability to intervene when colleges and universities do a questionable job of handling students’ complaints of sexual assault.

Trump is also attempting to dismantle the nation’s public safety net for family planning, with an assist from his party in Congress. The president has signed legislation encouraging states to withhold federal family planning dollars from Planned Parenthood. The latest version of Republican’s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act would eliminate the birth control mandate – which is also under fire from Trump’s health department – not to mention maternity coverage requirements.

Every repeal attempt has contained a measure to block women on Medicaid from using their insurance at Planned Parenthood – measures that would shutter scores of Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. And the administration is poised to give the green light to states, like Texas, that axe Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.

The White House also has aims to zero out funding for the government-funded Legal Services Corporation, which is the main source of legal assistance for women attempting to escape domestic violence, when Congress passes a budget this fall.

Finally, there’s US supreme court justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia, who observers say “has all the makings of an extreme anti-abortion justice”. Trump named Gorsuch eleven days into his presidency, fulfilling a longtime campaign promise to nominate justices who will vote to overturn Roe v Wade. Molly Redden

Criminal justice

Much of what the federal government can do on criminal justice is left to Congress, since most criminal justice happens at state and local, rather than federal levels. However, Trump’s administration hasn’t spared much time doing what it can to reverse a roughly decades long retreat from the peak of tough-on-crime, mass-incarceration dogma.

So far, efforts on criminal justice have been much more sizzle than steak, but the prospect of dramatic policy change looms just around the corner. Stuffed in a suite of executive orders signed in February, Trump commissioned a taskforce to make recommendations on combating “the menace of rising crime”, which has been an enduring theme of the administration despite being debunked by experts. That taskforce, which reportedly, and curiously, does not include police chiefs or criminologists is scheduled to make its recommendations on 27 July.

“If you’re going to see anything from the Trump administration proposing new [or longer] mandatory minimums and a general return to the tough on crime tactics, I think you’ll see those recommendations made by the task force,” said Ames Grawert, a criminal justice researcher with the Brennan Center for Justice.

It remains unclear how much support there might be in Congress for taking up such recommendations. As recently as December there was real momentum behind a bipartisan bill to make sentencing less punitive, not more.

In the interim, attorney general Jeff Sessions has instructed federal prosecutors to seek the highest possible penalty in every case, and has championed initiatives to push state cases for federal prosecutors to obtain harsher sentencing.

In another reversal from the Obama era, Sessions has also signaled that the DoJ will not use its authority to investigate or reform local police departments, even in cases where gross negligence, or rampant civil rights violations may be occurring. Sessions tried, and failed, to pause a consent decree negotiated in Baltimore after the Freddie Gray unrest, and his department has so far flaked-out of a similar effort that was slated for Chicago under the previous administration.

“We will not sign consent decrees for political expediency that will cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of the criminals,” Sessions wrote in an 18 April op-ed in USA Today. Jamiles Lartey

51,"Hundreds of climate scientists, including a number from the United States, have applied to work in France after the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, appealed for them to come and help “make out planet great again”.

The slogan was a deliberate parody of the climate science-denying Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “make America great again”.

Germany has announced it is to set up a similar scheme.

While most of the researchers applied for short sabbaticals, 154 were seeking to work in France for four or more years, Dr Anne Peyroche, chief research officer of the CNRS, a national research agency, told the journal Nature.

“Applications continue to come in every hour,” she said.

In June, Mr Macron said those disillusioned by Mr Trump’s dismissal of accepted science about climate change would discover a very different situation in France.

“To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second homeland,” he said.

“I call on them: come and work here with us. To work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. I can assure you, France will not give up the fight.

“I call on you to remain confident. We will succeed, because we are fully committed, because wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: Make our planet great again.”

The French scheme, worth a total of about £53m, offers four-year grants worth up to about £1.3m. Officials were also headhunting some leading researchers, Dr Peyroche added. The 50 scientists given grants under the scheme will be announced towards the end of this year.

Ashley Ballantyne, a bioclimatologist at Montana University, is one of the applicants.

52,"As the head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon reportedly locked horns with Fox News chief Roger Ailes during the 2016 presidential campaign. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/Getty Images

Before Steve Bannon could focus his full attention on Hillary Clinton, he had another unlikely nuisance to vanquish: Fox News.

The first Republican presidential debate in August 2015 will be remembered for Fox's Megyn Kelly's combative questioning of Donald Trump's distasteful comments about women. It was a full year before Bannon would even formally become a part of Trump's campaign.

And yet it was Bannon's response at that tenuous moment that brought the mighty conservative cable news juggernaut to its knees amid a highly charged GOP primary race.

Following that first debate, Bannon, the then-chairman of the virulently anti-establishment Breitbart News, decided to launch a concerted attack on Kelly and her credibility. Between the Thursday night when the debate took place and Sunday evening, Breitbart published 25 stories on Kelly and accused Fox of ""trying to take out Donald Trump.""

According to Joshua Green's new book, ""Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and The Storming of The Presidency,"" Fox News chief Roger Ailes was panicked.

""Steve, this isn't fair and it's killing us,"" Ailes called to tell Bannon. ""You have to stop it.""

Bannon's retort, in part: ""F--- that.""

Kelly didn't back down, continuing to mock and challenge Trump on her nightly program. But neither did Breitbart. Bannon himself composed a point-by-point case against Kelly titled, ""The Arrogance of Power: Megyn Kelly's Good Journalism."" Later, the debate fell into the gutter. Another Breitbart story read: ""Flashback: Megyn Kelly Discusses Her Husband's Penis and Her Breasts on Howard Stern.""

Trump was livid all the while too, taking his shots at Fox on his favorite medium, Twitter.

Out of options, Ailes, Green reports, dispatched his personal lawyer to Washington to plead with Bannon to stand down. But the attorney, Peter Johnson Jr., made a crucial mistake. He presented Bannon with a threat: If Bannon didn't stop his war on Fox's biggest star, he would never again appear on Fox News.

Bannon was incensed. It was the wrong way to approach the former naval officer who reveled in the darkest arts of conflict.

""She's pure evil,"" Bannon said of Kelly. ""And she will turn on him one day. We're going full-bore. We're not going to stop. I'm going to unchain the dogs.""

Besides, Bannon confessed to another associate, ""The traffic is absolutely filthy!""

The conversation with Johnson was short and filled with venom.

To finish it, Bannon told him to go back to New York and ""quote me to Roger.""

""Go f--- yourself.""

Every president has an essential strategist attached to him, an often cryptic figure who guides a politician through the political and policy quandaries of history. George W. Bush had Karl Rove. Barack Obama had David Axelrod. Green, a Bloomberg Businessweek correspondent, argues in his tome that Trump's political shepherd is unquestionably Bannon.

What's unique about Bannon is how much of his work he did on the periphery and how unlikely his path was to the helm of the final months of the Trump campaign and then ultimately to his current seat as chief strategist in the White House.

Bannon was initially introduced to Trump by David Bossie, a longtime conservative activist and chief agitator of the Clintons, to provide informal counsel on a presidential bid. But Bannon never thought much of Trump's chances at the outset.

Yet after the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, in which Trump was roasted by President Barack Obama and teeming from the humiliation, Bossie brought Bannon to Trump Tower for a meeting where they appeared to click on instinct.

Green lays out the striking similarities: ""Like Trump, Bannon had cycled through multiple marriages, and was rich, brash, charismatic, volcanic, opinionated and never ruffled by doubt. He, too, was a businessman and a deal maker, and he had faced down moguls ranging from Ted Turner to Michael Ovitz. Fluent in the argot of Wall Street and Hollywood, Bannon specialized in media, having moved from financing television shows and films to making movies himself. He had plenty of experience maneuvering among the outsize egos of aggressive billionaires such as Trump and seemed to possess a sixth sense about how to connect with them.""

Other Trump aides noticed the connection quickly. When Trump attended a conservative Freedom Summit event in South Carolina, Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide, remembers the candidate-to-be cooing, ""Where's my Steve? Where's my Steve?""

""It was clear the connection was genuine,"" said Roger Stone. ""Because Steve is a slob and Trump hates slobs.""

While Green's book is equipped with catchy quotes by Trumpworld's vast array of colorful players and enjoys early cooperation from Bannon, chapters go by where Bannon is left almost unmentioned and the reader is left to wonder his precise role in important Trump decisions. Much time is instead spent diving into the role of Bannon associates, like the author Peter Schweizer, who penned ""Clinton Cash,"" and the strange and reclusive megadonor Robert Mercer who Bannon dubbed as ""The Godfather.""

The one area Bannon is directly tethered and devoted to from the outset is how to take out the Clintons. ""My goal is that by Nov 8th, when you hear her name, you're gonna throw up,"" he said.

And it was his keen observation of how to learn and adjust from the past failed Clinton wars that proved crucial to the unforeseen winning 2016 strategy.

Bannon, Green writes, understood that Republicans blundered in defeating the Clintons in the 1990s because they overreached and overindulged loony theories to the point that they lost credibility with everyone but their own. Amassing unflattering facts about Clinton would be more powerful than beating the drum on far-reaching conspiracy-fueled storylines, Bannon asserted.

""Back then, they couldn't take down Bill because they didn't do that much real reporting, they couldn't get the mainstream guys interested, and they were always gunning for impeachment no matter what. People got anesthetized to outrage,"" Bannon is quoted telling Green.

That's why Schweizer's book became so important; it was an outlet to establish a series of facts, (along with some partisan assumptions) that targeted only the last decade of the Clinton Foundation and its web of questionable financial entanglements across the globe as Hillary Clinton served as the nation's chief diplomat.

Much of the information that Schweizer and Bannon dug up was placed first not in Breitbart, but The New York Times, which had millions of Democratic readers and was guaranteed to be picked up by the rest of the media, as the gold standard of journalism. Of course, then Breitbart and Drudge could use the Times' stamp of approval to carry the narrative and take it to more extreme anti-Clinton heights.

""We're aggregating, we'll pull stuff from the left. It's a rolling phenomenon. Huge traffic. Everybody's invested,"" Bannon said.

Green even found that Democrats noticed Bannon's more sophisticated approach to implementing the ""vast right wing conspiracy"" against the first female presidential nominee of a major party.

""They've adapted into a higher species,"" said Chris Lehane, a Clinton White House staffer.

Even with all that ammunition, Trump's odds were long and hard. At the urging of Rebekah Mercer, the megadonor's daughter, Bannon was installed to lead the campaign in mid-August 2016 following a dark national convention, rotting poll numbers and the ouster of chairman Paul Manafort.

Prior to this, Bannon didn't speak with Trump regularly, Green notes, instead using the outside game to bolster him, by battling Fox, churning up information on Clinton and greasing important endorsements like that of Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.

But once Bannon had his hands on the steering wheel, he promised, ""It's not going to be a traditional campaign."" He urged an incessant branding of Clinton as corrupt, in press releases, on the trail -- ""Crooked Hillary"" -- and encouraging the ""Lock Her Up"" chants that reverberated through Trump venues.

At the campaign's lowest ebb, when the Access Hollywood tape was revealed showing Trump making vile comments about his ability as a star to grope women's genitals, Bannon's mantra ahead of the final debate was ""Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,"" according to Green's account.

""It's gonna be ugly,"" Bannon acknowledged to another aide. ""But there's a path.""

It's why it was Bannon's brainchild to bring former President Bill Clinton's accusers to the debate site in Las Vegas and re-tar him as an accused rapist. It was the most blatant and desperate form of merciless political warfare, but it helped neutralize a negative cloud around Trump.

Green reports that in watching the women who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, Bannon learned on-camera testimony was powerful because his victims were attacked decades earlier ""and were now elderly women and thus inherently sympathetic.""

""We're going to turn him into Bill Cosby,"" Bannon said of Clinton. ""He's a violent sexual predator who physically abuses women who he assaults.""

Trump, of course, ruthlessly attacked the former president during that third and final debate. (""Darkness is good,"" Bannon counseled Trump.) Four days later, Trump's slumping numbers began to recover.

Trump's private polling continued to move in the right direction but Bannon was still dogged by a nagging question of why Clinton wasn't campaigning in Midwestern battleground states where he was tracking his candidate's gains. Why didn't they see what he did?

Only when Election Night unfolded did it dawn on Bannon that Clinton had made the same foolish mistake as the Republicans who tried to defeat her in the past: She'd become so intoxicated with the righteousness of her cause, she became trapped in her own bubble.

The result: The most staggering upset in political history, with the makings of a Hollywood movie.

But Bannon rejected that comparison, ""Brother, Hollywood doesn't make movies where the bad guys win.""

55,"Charlie Gard has reportedly been granted permanent residence in the US so he can travel to America to receive experimental treatment. The decision by US Congress may oblige Great Ormond Street Hospital to release the sick baby so he can receive nucleoside therapy.

Nebraska representative Jeff Fortenberry said an amendment has been passed ""that grants permanent resident status to Charlie Gard and family so Charlie can get the medical treatment he needs"".

Charlie, who has a rare genetic disease, is being kept on life support at the children's hospital amid an ongoing court battle between his parents, who want him to receive the treatment, and doctors, who say it is unlikely to work and it is kinder for life support to be switched off.

An American doctor flew to London this week to examine the critically ill baby as part of a last-ditch attempt to persuade a High Court judge the treatment stands a chance of working.

Charlie, who was born on 4 August 2016, has a faulty RRM2B gene, which affects the cells responsible for energy production and respiration, leaving him unable to move or breath without a ventilator.

Dr Michio Hirano, a neuroscientist from Columbia University in New York, is said to have spent over five hours trying to convince doctors, along with an expert from a Vatican hospital in Rome. The specialist told the High Court nucleoside therapy has a 10 per cent chance of improving Charlie's condition, adding his research “clearly indicates” it reduces muscle weakness in patients with a similar genetic disorder.

“This is the best scientific data we have,” he told the judge last week, adding he was prepared to extrapolate the findings on patients with TK2 depletion to Charlie’s genetic deficiency. “These are small numbers, but with very rare diseases we must use every patient and gather as much detail from each patient as possible.”

He said he hoped a high dose of nucleosides, which are found naturally in the body, would enter Charlie’s cells, affect the mitochondria and prove “therapeutic”.

But Katie Gollop QC, representing the hospital, called the doctor’s findings “all very theoretical”, saying: “You're trying to translate one experiment to another.”

If President Donald Trump’s latest appointee to his election integrity commission is to be believed, more than a thousand noncitizens have cast ballots in Virginia, potentially changing the outcome of several elections, and many more are likely doing so across the country.

Election officials and experts say there’s plenty of reason to doubt those claims. But they could still provide a blueprint for Trump’s commission, which has so far hinted at tighter restrictions on voting in the name of cracking down on alleged voter fraud, and for the administration’s broader agenda on voting rights.

When Trump set up the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May to investigate vulnerabilities in the country’s elections, voting rights groups warned that it might be a pretense for the administration to pursue a more nefarious goal: to cook up evidence of widespread voter fraud and use that to pass legislation that makes it harder for people to vote. These concerns were reinforced by several of Trump’s appointments to the committee, including vice chair Kris Kobach, who has alleged rampant voter fraud in his home state of Kansas. The committee’s first major action was to request extensive data about every registered voter in every state—a move nearly every state has at least partially resisted.

Last week, Trump announced another appointment to the committee: J. Christian Adams, an attorney who has spearheaded efforts to purge voter rolls across the country. Over the past year, Adams has published two reports alleging widespread voter fraud in Virginia.

Alien Invasion in Virginia and Alien Invasion II claim that more than 5,500 noncitizens have registered to vote in Virginia. Of these, the reports found that 1,852 cast nearly 7,500 ballots over last few decades. Produced by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, the nonprofit law firm where Adams is president and general counsel, and a conservative group called the Virginia Voters Alliance, the reports argue that these ballots could have thrown several close elections in Virginia in recent years. The reports, which use UFO-themed covers and space-alien clip art, were covered by Fox News and other conservative media outlets.

To fix this alleged problem, the reports call for stricter laws that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they vote. Kobach and Adams are currently litigating a case to allow states to require a birth certificate or passport to register. Voting rights groups on the other side of the case argue that doing so violates existing federal law and worry that the commission will recommend changes to that law.

“This is the real foreign influence on American elections,” Adams said on Fox News this spring. “Foreigners are getting on American voter rolls and, as we documented, casting ballots by the thousands.”

But election law experts say Adams’ methodology seems designed to conjure voter fraud where a likelier explanation for many of the discrepancies may be simple human error in checking the wrong box on a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

Adams and his colleagues based their research on forms that Virginians fill out at the DMV, asking them to check a box indicating whether they are citizens. The DMVs send a notice to local election registrars when people check “no” or fail to check either box. The local registrars then send notices to those voters, asking them to confirm their citizenship within 14 days or be removed from the rolls. Adams and his colleagues collected the names of these people who have been removed, as well as at least some of their voter registration forms and voting history. The reports’ conclusion seems to assume that the people removed were indeed noncitizens who had self-reported the truth and been caught, rather than people who might have checked the wrong box or skipped the question accidentally.

“Remember, the 5,500-plus registrants removed for citizenship problems are only those who were caught,” Alien Invasion II states. “They were caught by happenstance, usually by telling the motor vehicle agency they were not a citizen after previously telling the agency they were a citizen. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the full, and unknown, extent of noncitizens registered to vote far exceeds the 5,500-plus who were removed.”

The report continues, “This is an especially sound conclusion when you consider that virtually nothing is being done to detect noncitizens on the voter rolls in Virginia.” But some election officials and experts say this methodology is flawed and could lead to problematic solutions to the exaggerated issue of voter fraud.

“With respect to a commission where allegations of noncitizen voting are so particularly prominent in the founding of the commission and otherwise, and where the concern is those allegations will be wildly inflated beyond any actual facts on the ground,” says Justin Levitt, an election law expert at the Loyola Law School and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Obama administration who has reviewed the reports, “it is disturbing that the commission should welcome to its ranks somebody who takes this particular approach to investigating voter fraud.”

Adams joined the Justice Department in 2005, when, the department’s inspector general later found, it was illegally using political ideology to fill its Civil Rights Division with conservative lawyers. Working in that division, Adams helped bring—and win—the first-ever Voting Rights Act case alleging black discrimination against whites. He also recommended charges against members of the New Black Panther Party for intimidating white voters, a case that quickly became an obsession of conservative media outlets.

After resigning from the department in protest of the Obama administration’s backtracking on that case, Adams began a campaign to purge voter rolls across the country. He started by threatening and filing lawsuits in small, rural counties with sizable minority populations, before expanding to larger Democratic counties in swing states, with the aim of forcing local election officials to agree to voter list cleansing programs. (Adams denies any political or racial motivations and insists that his efforts do not remove any legitimately registered voters from the rolls.)

As Adams and his colleagues requested the canceled voter registration lists from state and local officials, some county registrars expressed concern to one another that the data would be misconstrued. Adams was aware of their concerns and included in Alien Invasion IIemails that he obtained between local voting officials. “[T]hey are consciously misrepresenting the data they are receiving from us,” Lawrence Haake, the recently retired registrar for Chesterfield County, warned in an email to fellow registrars. The report uses these warnings, as well as a legal dispute with the state about what records Virginia’s Election Commission was legally required to turn over to Adams and his colleagues, to allege a cover-up on the part of Virginia’s election officials.

But in other parts of the reports, and in an email to Mother Jones, Adams acknowledges that the data could be flawed. In the email, Adams argues that if anyone’s to blame for faulty data, it’s the state. “It’s been curious to hear the report attached [sic] because some of the people removed for non-citizenship were really citizens,” he says. “That’s the government screwing up once again. It’s as outrageous that eligible citizens were removed under Virginia’s broken list maintenance policies as it was that aliens were allowed to register and vote. You notice those critics shut up once they realized the ‘misconstrued’ data was really their own mistake in the first place. Virginia’s chief methodology for identifying alien voter registrations by depending on self-reporting should give anyone concerns as it does not reflect the total number registered still undiscovered.”

It didn’t take long for errors in the reports to surface. In May, the conservative Washington Times covered the reports, which it said “should give an early sense for the problems that are likely to be turned up by President Trump’s new voter integrity commission.” The story used the example of Maureen Erickson, who was singled out in Alien Invasion II for listing a Guatemalan address on her registration form. “Ms. Erickson voted in 14 different elections—most recently in 2008—before her registration was canceled,” the report stated.

But Erickson is indeed a US citizen, living in Guatemala as a missionary. Her husband contacted the Times to clarify the situation, and the paper ran a follow-up story explaining the mix-up. “I think it is odd that they chose ‘Maureen Erickson’ as their poster child for voter fraud,” her husband, Todd Erickson, said in an email to the Times. “There was obviously not much additional research done on the person that they held up as an example of this illegal activity.”

The reports include the personal information of thousands of voters, along with the implication that these people have committed felonies.

Edgardo Cortes, the state election commissioner, explained to the Times, “It happens all the time where people accidentally indicate ‘no’ to citizenship and either don’t receive the letter or don’t return it in time before the removal happens.” (Cortes did not respond to requests for comment from Mother Jones.)

Anna Leider, the registrar for the city of Alexandria, in northern Virginia, says that people who are removed from the rolls due to how they filled out their forms at the DMV often reregister later. “In Alexandria, most of the people who were canceled for citizenship later reregistered,” she says. “It was an error at DMV. It was not that they really were not citizens. I won’t say that there are no noncitizens who have gotten registered to vote in Virginia, but the numbers they cite are wildly inflated.”

The reports target Leider, whom Adams sued last year as part of his work to force jurisdictions to purge their voter rolls. The webpage for Alien Invasion II has an illustration of space aliens with a sign pointing toward Alexandria and a caption that reads, “Take us to your Leider.”

Levitt, the former Justice Department official, says the data analysis in Adams’ reports was “not just incredibly inflated; designed—and specifically designed—to get inaccurate information.” He reached out to some of the thousands of people named in the reports for having their registrations canceled. (Mother Jones also called more than a dozen people on the list but none responded to requests for comment.) “It is possible that a few of the individuals that he’s mentioned were indeed ineligible, but I did speak to citizens who were falsely accused of registering while noncitizens, which means they were falsely accused of committing felonies based on research that Mr. Adams was warned specifically by officials did not mean what he wants it to mean,” he says. “They are livid. The people I talked to include naturalized citizens, they included native-born citizens, at least one service member.”

Asked by email if he was concerned about mislabeling legal voters as felons, Adams replies, “Again, that would be Virginia’s mistake, not ours. Why don’t you ask them why they are removing eligible voters? You should applaud our efforts and finding this, not snipe.” Adams has a point: Virginia’s system does appear to remove thousands of citizens from the rolls due to mistakenly checked boxes at the DMV. But he hasn’t seen that as a reason to question his reports’ findings or to reconsider his full-throated claims of fraud.

The reports include the personal information of thousands of voters, including their names, addresses, birth dates, and telephone numbers, along with the implication that these people have committed felonies. It also initially included some voters’ Social Security numbers, although these were removed in a later version. Adams says the state made all of this information public and is to blame for any inappropriate disclosures. “The Commonwealth of Virginia published the underlying reports for PILF ‘unredacted’ in compliance with local open records law,” he writes. Nonetheless, publishing these people’s names and information with the implication that they committed voter fraud could open Adams and his colleagues to allegations of defamation, says David Ardia, a University of North Carolina law professor who specializes in media law.

Responding to a series of follow-up questions, Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for the Public Interest Legal Foundation, replied, “When you have a serious question, get back to us and we’ll answer it. The report clearly stated what the records were and contemplated there were errors by the government. Nor did it call anyone criminals.”The reports make repeated references to criminality; Alien Invasion in Virginia states, “Each of the aliens we have discovered to have registered or voted has likely committed a felony.”

If Trump’s election commission is able to collect voter data from enough cooperating states, it then plans to compare the data with various federal databases in order to find cases of fraud, a process that experts say will result in thousands of false positives. But if Adams’ Alien Invasion reports are any indication, the commission might not find that disqualifying.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6o7fs1/trump_election_commissioner_used_dubious_data_to/,motherjones.com

“He was of no help,” grumbled one GOP senator, who doubted that Trump would have done much to defend lawmakers from political attacks if the bill passed.

A member of Trump’s team says their boss bears no responsibility for the embarrassing loss because McConnell was in charge of putting together a Senate package.

“This was McConnell’s deal,” said a White House official when asked what went wrong.

After McConnell conceded Monday night that he did not have enough votes to pass the Senate version of the healthcare bill, he suffered another defeat Tuesday when GOP colleagues quickly smacked down his backup plan: pass the ObamaCare repeal-only bill that cleared the Senate and House in 2015.

But a senior Senate Republican aide bristled at the notion that McConnell fumbled the ball.

“Repeal-only is what Leader McConnell wanted to do in January. The president wanted to do repeal and replace,” the aide said.

McConnell told reporters in January that the GOP healthcare bill would closely resemble the repeal-only bill, which the Republican-controlled Senate and House passed two years ago but then-President Obama vetoed.

At the time, McConnell and other GOP leaders were debating whether to set up a two- or three-year transition period to give themselves time to come up with replacement legislation.

Trump, however, put pressure on Congress to keep ObamaCare’s most popular provisions: protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and the ability of young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26.

He was backed up by centrists such as Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsCollins reiterates call for legislation to protect Mueller investigation GOP nerves on edge after Sinema takes lead over McSally Parties start gaming out 2020 battleground MORE (R-Maine), who said it would be better to have a detailed plan for replacing the law before repealing it.

Now, Trump is calling on Congress to let ObamaCare fail, raising the possibility the White House will stop making cost-sharing reduction payments, which insurance companies use to help low-income people afford insurance.

“As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!” the president tweeted Tuesday.

Just floating the notion angered some GOP senators.

“He’s the president of the United States. These people are folks who are looking to him to help them,” said a second Republican senator who requested anonymity to discuss Trump’s stance frankly.

The lawmaker said that Trump can’t simply let the law fail and leave millions of people without insurance options just because “of something that past president did,” referring to Obama.

Trump is scheduled to host the Senate GOP conference for lunch at the White House on Wednesday.

Tensions between Trump and Senate Republicans have been a theme of the months-long effort to win passage of the healthcare legislation.

After an initial Senate bill was revealed, allies of Trump ran scathing television and radio ads attacking Sen. Dean Heller Dean Arthur HellerThe Hill's Morning Report — Washington resets after midterms, Sessions fired Election Countdown: Midterm fallout | What we learned | What to watch next | Trump calls out lawmakers who lost | A look at the undecided races | Vote deepens urban, rural divide | Women help deliver Dems House | McConnell thanks Trump for Senate gains Schumer: 2020 'doesn't bode well' for GOP MORE (R-Nev.), who had announced his opposition to the measure. Heller is considered the most vulnerable Senate Republican up for reelection next year.

McConnell immediately called White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to complain that the attack ads were counterproductive and only threatened to push Heller further away.

As McConnell tried again to win enough GOP votes for the healthcare bill, it was revealed that two Republicans mulling primary challenges against Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFlake slams Trump for doubting Arizona vote count: No evidence of 'electoral corruption' Flake: Whitaker shouldn't oversee Mueller probe Election Countdown: Arizona Senate race still too close to call | Florida vote tally fight heats up | Trump calls for Abrams to 'move on' MORE (R-Ariz.), one of Trump’s most outspoken critics in the 2016 presidential campaign, had talked to White House officials about their potential bids.

Trump exasperated McConnell last month when he tweeted that Republican senators should immediately repeal ObamaCare and work on replacement legislation at a later date if they could not get their bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, over the finish line.

Republican sources close to McConnell complained that it gave conservatives such as Sens. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulGOP pollster says Republicans could break with Trump on Saudi Arabia Overnight Defense: Trump says 15,000 troops could deploy to border | Mattis insists deployment is not 'stunt' | Pompeo calls for Yemen peace talks in November GOP senators press Trump to halt nuclear energy talks with Saudi Arabia MORE (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzKasich rips 'fear mongering' about migrant caravan Exit poll: More native Texans voted for O’Rourke than Cruz Setting caps on political spending strikes at the heart of free speech MORE (R-Texas) and Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeCongress must make sentencing reform priority for public safety MyPillow CEO to attend White House opioid discussion Congress raises pressure on Saudi Arabia MORE (R-Utah) “a place to go” if they opposed the Senate bill.

Lee helped drive a stake through the foundering bill Monday when he announced he would vote against the motion to proceed to it, surprising White House officials and Senate Republican leaders alike.

McConnell had argued to his colleagues that if they voted against the Senate bill, they would be voting to keep ObamaCare as the status quo and that Republican leaders would be forced to negotiate with Democrats to shore up ObamaCare’s ailing insurance markets.

While Vice President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price met with governors over the weekend to build support for the Senate healthcare bill, GOP senators complained the president did little to build public support for the legislation.

To an extent, the Senate GOP’s annoyance with Trump has been tempered by its low expectations.

“People expect that. It’s already baked,” the first GOP lawmaker said of Trump’s actions.

Trump’s defenders in the Senate point out that he made efforts to corral wavering senators.

He invited all 52 members of the Senate Republican Conference for a meeting shortly before the July Fourth recess to give them a pep talk and also invited moderates and conservatives to sit down with him over lunch to discuss their concerns with the legislation.

Other actions by Trump have irked many GOP senators.

The president’s repeated calls to change the Senate’s rules and eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to circumvent, was one aggravation.

Senators saw this as meddling in procedural questions, which McConnell has repeatedly argued are the Senate’s prerogative.

They also said it showed Trump’s ignorance of how the Senate works.

McConnell has planned all along to pass healthcare reform and tax reform under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass. Getting rid of the filibuster would do little, if anything, to help Republicans pass a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Trump peeved other Republican senators earlier this month when he pressured them to cancel their August recess, a mid-year break that is usually sacrosanct.

“I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!” he tweeted.

McConnell relented soon after and agreed to cut the first two weeks of the five-week August recess.

A rumor is now circulating within the Senate Republican Conference that Trump is likely to up the ante by calling on senators not to take any recess in August until they pass healthcare legislation, a scenario that is unpopular with many lawmakers.

60,"Chinese participation is critical for global efforts on climate change. With its economic growth and rampant infrastructure construction, China consumes as much coal as the rest of the world combined. The burning of coal, which is at the core of the power, steel and cement industries in the country, generates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. So environmental advocates and officials around the world constantly say China must break its coal addiction.

But unlike in the United States, Chinese leaders and senior officials have consistently said that climate change is a serious problem and acknowledged that changing the energy mix to move away from fossil-fuel sources is important.

And because of its air pollution crisis, China announced policies in 2013 to limit the use of coal in the country’s three largest population centers. More recently, scientists have said that there is a dangerous cycle at work: Weather patterns from climate change are exacerbating the smog.

“China is cutting back on coal because of its lethal costs to human health as well as its high carbon emissions, and plans to transition to the energy sources of tomorrow, rather than yesterday,” said Isabel Hilton, founder of Chinadialogue, a prominent website that reports on environmental issues and policy. “President Trump seems intent on reviving a 19th-century energy source rather than pursuing the promise of the 21st century.”

Mr. Trump’s pro-coal talk, and the unlikelihood that his administration will pressure China to cut back on fossil fuels, might mean that pro-coal interests in China, including among state-owned energy companies, will try harder to push back against officials putting limits on coal.

But in recent years, coal consumption in China has declined slightly, surprising many analysts and researchers. China’s economic slowdown — from decades of double-digit annual growth to 6.7 percent last year — has been a major factor. Analysts say there appeared to be an increase in coal use during part of 2016 because of economic stimulus policies, but preliminary statistics released in February indicate that overall coal consumption declined last year compared with 2015.

Given such numbers, researchers say China may reach a carbon emissions peak in 2025 — five years ahead of its stated goal of 2030.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/62d7rp/china_poised_to_take_lead_on_climate_after_trumps/,nytimes.com
61,"It’s just been recommended to me that it’s a good time to read Margaret Atwood’s, The Handmaid’s Tale. I agree, but unfortunately I’ve already read it, probably at a time that wasn’t as good as now, but I haven’t got the time to reread it as I’m currently reading another book that I’ve also been told ‘it’s a good time to read,’ Sinclair Lewis’ It Could Never Happen Here. I’m reading It Could Never Happen Here after having just finished Camus’ The Plague, it also having been recommended to me on the basis of ‘it’s a good time to read.’ Other literary titles that seem to be being recommended as apropos are the unimaginative dystopian trio of 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451. Frankly if you’re over the age of 21 and haven’t already read these then I guess you’ve probably been too busy watching America’s Got Talent while masturbating into a sock. Recently I’ve also been recommended, and purchased, Assholes: A Theory, by Aaron James, A People’s History of the United States, by Howard Zinn, and a rather more upbeat title, Utopia for Realists: Why Making the World a Better Place Isn’t a Fantasy and How We Can Do It, by Rutger Bregman. I suspect that by the time I get round to finish reading these it will no longer be ‘a good time’ to read them, as Chelsea Clinton will have just become the president having edged out Kim Kardashian in an election that was so close it had to be resolved in the most democratic means available to a celebrity worshiping society, a naked mud wrestling splashdown, broadcast on pay per view, in high definition, surround sound. It’s either this or that sun dried fart of a president, Donald Trump, will have reduced our species to a pile of radioactive dust. I’ve also heard that Amazon has seen a surge in people wanting to read Mein Kampf, maybe because ‘it’s a good time.’

I just finished reading Camus’ The Plague, not as famous as The Stranger, but certainly no less skillfully written. Camus’ The Plague is a stifling, suffocating tale of a small Algerian town placed under quarantine after an outbreak of bubonic plague. It has been suggested that the story is an allegory of how Nazi ideology spread throughout Germany in the years leading up to World War 2, and the seemingly futile efforts of the French Resistance as they tried to find ways of overcoming the Nazi occupation.

While reading The Plague, it didn’t require any great leap of imagination to liken the spread of a highly contagious disease to the rapid spread of the alt right ideology. (An absolutely shameless and poor attempt to segue into what it is that I’m trying to say. I could have actually put in my opening paragraph; if I hadn’t become side tracked by dystopian literature, and the equally dystopian level of nudity that I predict will be required to decide our governments of the future.)

Despite having a name that sounds like a keyboard short cut it should be no surprise that the alt right has gained the majority of its following through the internet. The internet has proven to be an ideal breeding ground to facilitate the pervasive spreading of an ideology that only a couple of years ago would never have been discussed in public. The anonymity afforded by the internet has enabled people to voice radical opinions and meet up with others holding similar views. Over a relatively short period of time the numbers of people that have banded together sharing concerns over immigration, Islamic terrorism, feminism, and the preservation of the right to the freedom of expression, have increased at an alarming rate. To help put this into context I refer to the arbiter of public consciousness, Google. Type the terms ‘alt right’ into Google and you’ll get a choice of just over a quarter of a billion results to look at. Search ‘Democratic Party’ and you get a measly 64 million hits, search ‘US Constitution’ and you have what appears like an anemic choice of just over 10 million sources to look at. If the internet is the new battleground then it’s obvious that the alt right are winning the war. Mind if you do a search for ‘evil cat’, that’ll get you 43 million responses. So whether or not we should be fearing an alt right, evil cat coalition, or that the internet is really nothing more than a digital rubbish tip of mankind’s deranged sensibilities, I’ll leave you to decide.

The alt right has used the right to the freedom of expression as a foothold to gain itself a tenuous amount of legitimacy. They promote themselves as being the only political ideology that truly upholds this right, the self proclaimed guardians of the first amendment. It’s most likely that they’ve been able to achieve this as they’ve held opinions that were unutterable in civilized gatherings for the past twenty years. This logic is however flawed as any morally bankrupt ideology would be able to lay claim having had their freedom of expression limited by societal norms and values. For instance, and much to my own chagrin, people are very reluctant to engage in conversation that are open to considering the benefits of necrophilia. The truth is that the freedom of speech for those with repugnant ideas is no less than anybody else’s, what has to also be considered is the right that a large number of people have to react to those that espouse hate filled ideologies.

When Milo Yiannopoulos discussed his opinion that relationships between middle aged men and teen boys can be ‘life affirming.’ Mr. Yiannopoulos had the freedom, and made the choice, to express this opinion. His publishers Simon & Schuster, who were due to publish Yiannopoulos’ book, then exercised their right to react to Yiannopoulos’ statement by withdrawing their support and cancelling the book deal.

When a person promotes racist values that another person finds to be offensive, that person has just exercised their right to express their opinion. Anyone who listens to an opinion that they might disagree with, or find offensive, then has the right to disassociate themselves from such persons, who express such opinions. Simply put, we all have the right to say whatever it is we want, but we should also realize that there might be consequences to what we choose to say, in the form of how others might choose to respond to it.

And this is where I believe that we find ourselves today. A sizable group of people have, through the internet, suddenly found themselves empowered to express an extremely polemic point of view, leaving us with a society that is essentially in shock. The alt right is shocked that they have been able to voice opinions after they’ve had to bite their tongues for so long. The liberals meanwhile, are shocked there are so many people with such horrible ideas, and not enough people are thinking about the children.

Researching the ideology of the alternative right feels like driving to the dentists during the rush hour, because it’s an ideology that’s driven by fear, promotes intolerance and ultimately arrives at its final destination of self-loathing. Essentially what underpins the political philosophy of the alt right – I say political philosophy even though it has a set of opinions that are about as diverse as a satnav system stuck going round a roundabout – is nihilism. The alt right essentially rejects any reality that is in conflict with its own. It simply ignores the fact that culturally, racially, and economically our societies have become complex. Diversity has been the result of technology being able to transport people and goods, more quickly and cheaper than ever before. This doesn’t appeal to the mindset of the alternative right.

Steve Bannon, doyen of the alt right and Donald Trump’s chief strategist, promotes what he calls economic nationalism. According to Bannon, economic nationalism is the antithesis of globalization. Economic nationalism puts the American worker first, particularly when that worker is a white male. Bannon’s idea of economic nationalism provides us with an almost tangible glimpse into what an alt right Utopia would look like. It hearkens back to the days of 1950’s America. An America that rewarded hard working men, provided they came in the right shade of white. America before the civil rights movement. As a baby boomer this was the America that Steve Bannon grew up in, which makes me wonder if economic nationalism is nothing more than Bannon’s fantasy to relive his youth; so he can murder his father and have sex with his mother in order to fulfill an Oedipal complex that has laid dormant in him for the best part of half a century. I tried to make that last bit sound funny, but I can’t. It’s difficult to make a joke about a man who has admitted in public that he respects the power of Satan and who might also, in my opinion probably does, harbor sexual fantasies for his own mother.

Bannon’s economic nationalism has been criticized as populist in its appeal. As being an ideology that over simplifies economic issues, reducing them to the sort of sound bites that appeal to a stigmatized group, which in this case happens to be the working class white male of the American Rust Belt. Perhaps the most fundamental premise at the foundation of the alt right ideology is a belief that western culture has been destroyed by years of liberal economic

policy. The sorts of policies that have made it easier for the free movement of goods and people have been blamed for causing the economic downturn that has caused the rust belt. Being opposed to economic policies that promote globalization is a perfectly valid opinion for a person to have, but this opinion starts to become a concern when it’s hijacked by a group of people that espouse populist rhetoric in order to appeal to a group of people and get them believing that they have been the targets of economic policies that have seen other ethnic groups taking their jobs. Such rhetoric is extremely effective at spreading fear and hatred of the groups that appeared to have not fared as poorly. This type of rhetoric can cause alarm as it echoes that of Hitler identifying the Jews as the cause of Weimar Germany’s economic disaster.

But if I’m honest then I have to admit that I’m utterly bored, even contemptuous towards the economy. Whilst all of us have grown up to unquestioningly believe that economics and politics are ingredients fundamental to the running of a developed society, politics and economics have been the exclusive domain of intellectuals and economists. On the one hand we are made to feel that the health of the economy we live in is so vital that it closely mirrors our own well being. If the economy was a game that truly affects us all then I’d refuse to play as I have very little understanding of the rules. In fact the only people who do know the rules seem to be the sort of people I read about after they’ve drained all the money out of a pension fund.

Banking, as far as I can tell, seems to be almost as precise a science as using a slot machine. You either blindly hope for the best, delude yourself into thinking you’ve worked out a system, or open it up when no one’s looking and rig the settings so it’ll pay out illegally. I Can Make You Hate Hardcover – Charlie Brooker

Just spend 5 minutes watching Bloomberg, inevitably you’ll hear two people trading economic jargon in a sort of duel to the death to prove who owns the most absurd lexicon. A man wearing a blue suit with a hair style so impossible that it defies all hitherto understanding of the laws of physics will open with an idea to “cultivate robust e-services,” the other participant in this discussion of virtual economic pugilism, parries this opening salvo and counters with “benchmark web-enabled e-commerce,” this backs the impossible hair into a corner, forcing them to respond with “scale out-of-the-box partnerships,” this for a moment catches his opponent off guard, he seems to stagger, his eyes roll back in his head, before he gathers his senses and unleashes a devastating combination of “brand vertical networks,” quickly followed by “productize clicks-and-mortar e-markets”. There’s an awkward pause as the hair realizes that he’s beaten, defeated in a contest that I failed to understand a single word of, and find hard to imagine that anyone else who’s just watched it has been able to comprehend.

The fact that the economic system is so unintelligible means that it relies on a public suspension of disbelief. A tacit understanding from the working classes that just because it sounds complicated, and that money is important, this imbues it with all the credibility that is necessary. I however am more cynical than that, and suspect that the financial sector has invented a lexicon so impenetrable so as to place itself outside of the realm of common sense, thus enabling those with an understanding of its strange, esoteric language, carte blanche to steal as much money as and when they like. The economy has done its best to marginalize the working class, who have then been told to hate immigrants, or globalization as being the reasons why they have lost their jobs, when in actual fact their frustrations should be focused on the bankers who will remain in their jobs irrespective of whatever government we might have.

If there’s one thing that the election of Donald Trump and Brexit should have taught all of us it’s that the working class, and in particular the white working class, are tired of being framed pejoratively by a media that has for too long looked down its nose at them. And this is an incredibly dangerous thing to have done which again has been seized upon by, the psycho with an unrealized fantasy of sleeping with his mother, Steve Bannon. Discrediting the media strikes a chord with working class people that have good reason to feel that it has failed to represent either them, or their concerns for a very long time. When a government is able to discredit a weak media it removes society’s most effective means of enforcing checks and balances upon that government. Being supported by a group of people that have long since seen it given up on listening to reason, who are now convinced that their government are the only voice of truth, inevitably empowers that government to do essentially whatever it pleases.

Trump had spoken, and his audience had heard him. Then I did what I’ve been doing for two and a half months now. I Googled “mainstream media is…” And there it was. Google’s autocomplete suggestions: “mainstream media is… dead, dying, fake news, fake, finished”. Is it dead, I wonder? Has FAKE news won? Are we now the FAKE news? Is the mainstream media – we, us, I – dying?

Despite trying to consider the Trump government, and the alternative right with an open mind, what I struggle to get beyond it its sense of nihilism. It seems to believe that everything that has been done over the course of the past 20 years has been wrong to such an extreme that everything must be discarded and replaced. It makes me feel that the last 20 years were all just a waste of time, and that we would have all been better off if we’d just stayed at home, watched The X Factor and masturbated into a sock, which is largely what I think most of us were doing. It rejects any idea that mankind is just one race, the human race. Instead it concentrates all of its malevolent energy into focusing on what makes people different. It then takes these differences and tries to convince mostly the white working class males, that these differences mean that diverse societies are incapable of peace or prosperity. The Utopia of the alternative right would seem to be a homogeneous society of people whose shade of white only varies according to how long ago it was they were last on holiday. However, whether these holidays could be taken abroad remains unclear. With the alternative right being so fearful of economic globalization and cultural diversity, holidaying in a country that dares to speak a different language or eat rice will probably not be possible if the fantasy of the alternative right comes to fruition.

I can see how the alternative right is being made to appeal to white, working class males. But I end where I started, with a quote from Camus’ The Plague, which is how I would feel if I found myself supporting the alternative right:

I was with them and yet I was alone. When I spoke of these matters they told me not to be so squeamish; I should remember what great issues were at stake. And they advanced arguments, often quite impressive ones, to make me swallow what none the less I couldn’t bring myself to stomach. The Plague – Albert Camus

62,"Former Vice President Al Gore will soon be resuming his preaching of fire and brimstone in a sequel to An Inconvenient Truth.

The sequel, titled An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power, will be shown in theaters on July 28. The trailer shows President Donald Trump downplaying climate change and pledging to cut back on funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and then Gore animatedly telling audiences of their need to fight against climate change.

The inconvenient truth about An Inconvenient Truth is that a judge – despite thinking that overall the film made a ""powerful"" argument that man-made climate change needs to be addressed – ruled in Britain that the film can only be shown in schools if students are aware of the nine major lies in the movie. Here are those nine lies, as reported by the UK Telegraph.

1. The melting of Greenland or West Antarctica would soon cause sea levels to increase as much as 20 feet. The judge ruled that the science suggests that Gore's prediction could happen in over a thousand years, but not in the ""near future,"" as Gore claimed in the movie.

It has been over a decade since An Inconvenient Truth came out and there is still ice in Greenland; there has also been little change in Antarctica's ice levels in the past 100 years. Sea level rises have also temporarily slowed by 20 percent; as a whole, sea levels have typically risen by roughly one to three millimeters per year, which is not abnormal.

None of these facts have stopped Gore and his supporters from claiming that Gore was proven correct on this point due to Hurricane Sandy. But there is no evidence that climate change caused the storm:

Even The Washington Post admitted, “Climate change does not cause storms and did not cause Superstorm Sandy. The historic record shows violent storms, some even more severe than Sandy, have struck the Northeast repeatedly.” The article quoted multiple scientists who disputed such attempts to place blame on “climate change.” As for climate change-induced sea level rise, the Post said there had been roughly 6 to 8 inches of increase which “somewhat worsened the coastal flooding.” Climatologist Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama Huntsville said, “Hurricane Sandy was a minimal hurricane. So, it is in no way indicative of a rising trend in hurricanes that might be attributed to global warming.” In addition, Colorado State University researchers William Gray and Phil Klotzbach told National Geographic that human activity on the formation and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes “is likely to be negligible.”

2. Pacific atolls in New Zealand had to be evacuated as a result of climate change. The judge ruled that there was no evidence to substantiate this claim; in fact, according to National Geographic, ""reef islands change shape and move around in response to shifting sediments"" and ""many of them are growing in size, not shrinking, as sea level inches upward.""

3. The Ocean Conveyor would be shut down entirely. The judge pointed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as evidence to the contrary, as they concluded that the conveyor could possibly slow down but it was ""unlikely"" to shut down altogether. In 2015, NASA concluded that data revealed that not only was there ""no significant slowing over the past 15 years,"" it ""may have even sped up slightly in the recent past.""

4. Gore presented two graphs that he claimed showed ""an exact fit"" that carbon dioxide resulted in higher temperatures. The judge concluded that while there is scientific evidence that carbon dioxide results in higher temperatures, the graphs Gore used in the film do not show ""an exact fit."" In fact, former meteorologist Brian Sussman pointed out that the graphs in the film show the opposite – higher levels of carbon dioxide came after higher temperature levels. Perhaps that's why the graphs are only shown briefly in the film.

5. Mt. Kilimanjaro would no longer have snow in less than ten years. At the time, the judge ruled that there was nothing linking the decline in snow on the mountain to climate change. In 2014 ecologists concluded that ""preliminary findings show that the ice is nowhere near melting"" and that while snow levels have declined, ""we are comfortable that its total melt will not happen in the near future.""

6. Lake Chad's water levels shrank due to climate change. The judge noted that Lake Chad's water levels were due to ""other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability."" The late Winston Churchill actually provided an explanation for Lake Chad's declining water levels in his 1899 book, writing, ""even Lake Chad, into which the Shari flows, appears to be leaking through some subterranean exit, and is rapidly changing from a lake into an immense swamp.""

7. Hurricane Katrina resulted from climate change. The judge ruled that there was no evidence to support that assertion. Here's more from The Blaze:

Now, Gore was partly right: damage to New Orleans was man-made. It was caused by a dire neglect of the levees protecting the city. And their improvement might not be enough to withstand another Katrina. As for Katrina being the new norm, Gore is wrong once more. No F3+ hurricane has landed on U.S. soil since Wilma in October 2005, the longest such “drought” ever recorded. Have Obama’s actions on climate helped? Or was there no problem in the first place?

8. Climate change is killing the polar bears. Gore claimed that polar bears were drowning because they were unable to find ice, but the judge couldn't find any evidence to support this assertion. The polar bear population has actually increased from 20,000 to 25,000 bears in 2005 to 22,633 to 32,257 bears in 2016.

9. Climate change was one of the factors causing the bleaching of coral reefs. The judge determined that it was hard to separate the impact of climate change on reef bleaching from other factors, such as pollution. However, there is evidence to suggest that when left on their own, reefs tend to bounce back from bleaching naturally.

Those are the nine biggest lies. Since they were so egregious, even a judge sympathetic to the climate change argument ruled students needed to be alerted. It's also worth noting that although Gore claimed that there would be more frequent heatwaves and higher intensity storms, according to The Daily Caller, the recent pause in warming and IPCC data on storms prove Gore wrong on both counts. Gore also predicted that there would no longer be any ice in the Arctic Ocean by 2014, a prediction that has also been way off.

By now, if Gore were correct, the planet would be at ""a point of no return,"" yet the world is still here and there are no signs of Armageddon springing from climate change. Given the lies and wildly inaccurate predictions from his first film, why should Gore's sequel be taken seriously at all?

63,"Brains, health, and SJW politics

What is reality? Does it actually exist, or is it just something our brains make up to help us survive?

How we perceive reality is indeed a construct of our brain, but, you can prove experimentally that there is indeed a real, physical world, with its own properties. A rock is real. It’s still there even if there is no eyes and brain to see it, it has a size, a weight, a shape. A person exists, even if no eyes and brain see it, it has its physical properties too. If you roll a ball on the ground it will end up in different places depending if the rock is in its path or not. You don’t need to observe it to be real.

So, although I think this is not a controversial point, even if you still have doubts about it, let’s work with this basis: reality exists.

How do brains work? They work by creating a model of reality, to help us act on it. The closer that model is to the real world, the better we understand the world, the better we are equipped to survive. A dog doesn’t have a brain as sophisticated as ours, so its model or reality is not as precise as ours. This comes with many disadvantages. It can’t understand many things that for us are simple, say, how a door works.

This was our great evolutionary advantage, our brains can build models of reality that are more precise and complete than other Earthly creatures. Because of this advantage, we can understand things other animals can’t, we can build things, antecipate events, predict the future. It’s really great.

What happens when our brains don’t work so well? What happens when our models of reality become wrong? We call that a mental illness, also known as being crazy. What do we do with mentally disturbed persons, whose brains have created a wrong version of reality? We treat them, we help them, depending on the severity, they may need to be institutionalized their whole life. Without a proper functioning model of reality, you simply cannot survive, so those people need medical help, and compassion.

Depending on the severity of the case, it might not really need treatment. You can have major flaws in your model of reality and still be able to function. You may think that the Earth is flat. You may think that magic makes your TV work. You may think there is a Flying Spaghetti Monster that controls your destiny. However, some mental model discrepancies, are severe enough that people need to be removed from society and treated. If you believe you’re a dog, and defecate on the streets and bite people, you cannot function in society. That’s an error in you model that is severe enough that you simply cannot function.

For many cases though, it’s ok, you can still hold a job, have a successful life. Nobody cares, as long as you don’t bother other people. It’s fine. We all hold some beliefs that are probably wrong.

Mental health is a really complex issue. Unlike a broken leg, you can’t just fix it. For the most part, it’s quite impossible to change the broken mental model of an insane person. You can try to control it, medicate it, but ultimately, you cannot really change it. That person will fight, kicking and screaming, and will swear that what she thinks is in fact real. Because for any given individual, what is real, is what their brain has modeled as real. You can refine this model of course, you can question your beliefs. But, if you have a mental illness, some of those wildly wrong assumptions simply cannot be challenged.

Now, we come to the world of modern SJW politics. In particular around gender identity. In the SJW, progressive, liberal world, there is this idea that people can be a different gender than what they were born with. And notice that I use the word be, not feel. You can feel whatever you want, which is to say your mental model of reality can be whatever you want. However, if we continue to obey the premisse that “reality exists” and is not subjective, then what is, and what your brain is telling you, are not the same thing.

Now, you can use whatever model of reality you prefer, you were born John but want to be called Sally? Fine, no problem. You were born Maria, but want to be called Trevor? Whatever, no problem.

But, if you are born a man, and want to be called a woman (or vice versa), you’re trying to impose on others a model of reality that is not accurate. There is proof in the physical world, in the form of DNA, chromosomes, that can be used to see if you’re one of two human genders: male or female. You are free to behave, dress, change names, to whatever you want. But you cannot change what reality is. I can address you by name, and avoid gender pronouns, to not hurt your feelings. That’s ok, feelings are important, they are also real. There is no reason to gratuitously hurt someone’s feelings. But sometimes truth hurts, reality hurts. But reality cannot be changed, even if you say the rock is a turtle, it is not, it’s still a rock.

If someone has a mental issue with their gender, it’s fine. I’m happy to call them by whatever name they want. But, unfortunately your brain does have a model dissonance with reality. In this day and age, unlike with other mental model disorders, you won’t be put in a mental institution, you can function in society, it’s fine. That’s a good thing. You can live a successful life. I can’t promise you’ll be happy though, no one can.

However, as with any other case of insanity, it’s impossible to convince the person that their mental model is wrong. Of course not, it’s the others that are wrong, it’s the world that is wrong. This is a universal consequence of mental illness unfortunately.

It would all be fine, if not for the fact that now, these ideas about gender identity seem to have become so popular, that the broken mental model of people with a reality perception disturbance is being pushed as valid, despite not matching reality. Laws are being passed to enforce new pronouns, to make it a crime to not address people by their preferred form, and other such measures.

It is literally insanity being put into laws.

Throughout human history, our civilization has worked hard to form more accurate mental models of the universe, to better understand it, and manipulate it. Now, we are witnessing a civilizational regression, where some people actually want to enforce models of thinking that do not match physical reality.

Not only that, but actually demonizing and being hostile to people whose model of reality is accurate. Having a proper model of reality in your brain is also known as being a sane, healthy, intelligent, person. It’s what has kept us going as a species. But now, modern day SJW politics are actively attacking sanity to replace it with insanity. Let the insane out, and put the sane in the asylum.

If this is allowed to flourish, then we are witnessing the decay of modern civilization. It was surprisingly short lived.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/62c4z3/brains_health_and_sjw_politics/,medium.com
64,"Demonstrating how O’Sullivan’s First Law (or Conquest’s Second Law), that every organization that is not explicitly right-wing, becomes left-wing over time, is so very true, the Science Fiction publisher Tor—hand in hand with the World Science Fiction Convention and Hugo Awards—has decided to celebrate the intransigence of and old pasty White person, who pretends to be an Indian (feather, not dot), by putting together an anthology based on Sen. Mitch McConnell’s response to her: “Nevertheless, she persisted“.

“Three short lines, fired over social media in response to questions of why Senator Elizabeth Warren was silenced on the floor of the United States Senate on February 7th, 2017, for daring to read aloud the words of Coretta Scott King. As this message was transmitted across the globe, it has become a galvanizing cry for people of all genders in recognition of the struggles that women have faced throughout history. To me, it is also serves as a reminder of the cyberpunk nature of our everyday lives, as technology can weave our hearts and minds in unity toward a greater cause.”

They were also, unsurprisingly, motivated by the Communist related “International Women’s Day”, which led a convicted terrorist to declare a laughable and ineffectual #DayWithoutAWoman on the same day…

Unsurprisingly, Tor.com doesn’t say anything about a Vietnamese refugee who spoke out against a man—”Commie Tommy” Hayden—who supported the regime that tortured her relatives and drove her family to flee half-way around the world.

The Trump Administration has announced it will strike data collection from the 2020 census. But make no mistake: We will be seen, we will be heard and we won't stop fighting until we achieve equality for LGBTQ people.

Last night, the Census Bureau issued an alarming corrective statement, asserting it had “inadvertently listed sexual orientation and gender identity as a proposed topic in the appendix” of a bureau report. The correction suggests that plans for data collection for the 2020 census had included LGBTQ people, but the Trump Administration has removed them. This is Trump’s latest move in a larger campaign to erase LGBTQ people from federal surveys and disrupt programs that provide direct assistance to the LGBTQ community.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services removed a question about sexual orientation from the National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants. Earlier this month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew two notices impacting data collection and implementation guidelines for a homelessness prevention initiative targeting LGBTQ youth.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/62d5nr/trump_administration_eliminates_lgbtq_data/,hrc.org

On Tuesday morning, Fox News political commentator Bill O’Reilly kicked off a media firestorm when he made fun of California Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA).

Specifically, O’Reilly joked that he wasn’t able to pay attention to Waters’s speech — in which she suggested that Trump supporters are less patriotic than those who resist the president — because he was too distracted by her “James Brown wig.”

That comment, as CBS News reports, has prompted plenty of controversy — including a growing call for the veteran Fox News host to be fired for his “racist” and “sexist” remarks:

People call on Fox News to fire @oreillyfactor after he called @MaxineWaters' hair a ""James Brown wig."" https://t.co/Yoaq9VThbD — Twitter Moments (@TwitterMoments) March 28, 2017

As Mediate notes, those condemning O’Reilly have run the gamut from Hollywood players:

It should be noted that O’Reilly apologized just hours after his remark, dedicating the opening segment of his show to reflecting on his comment on Waters.

Saying that he shouldn’t have made the “jest about her hair, which was dumb,” O’Reilly added:

“Talking Points believes Ms. Waters is totally sincere in her belief system and although many Americans disagree with her extremism at times, she deserves a hearing and should not be marginalized by political opponents. In fact I made that mistake this morning on Fox & Friends. I said in a simple jest that the congresswoman’s hair distracted me. Well that was stupid. I apologize. It had no place in the conversation.”

Waters, for her part, has since said that she’s “a strong, black woman” who “cannot be intimidated … undermined” or “thought to be afraid of Bill O’Reilly or anybody.”

The California Democrat took that notion even further, saying:

“Don’t allow these right-wing talking heads, these dishonorable people, to intimidate or scare you. Be who you are and do what you do. When a woman stands up and speaks truth to power, there will be attempts to put her down.”

Waters — who has represented California in Congress since 1991 — added that she’s “not going to go anywhere,” vowing to “stay on the issues.”",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/62bptg/after_his_james_brown_wig_joke_critics_demand/,ijr.com

69,"President Donald Trump has nominated a former corporate lawyer — who previously said that AT&T’s bid for Time Warner doesn’t pose a “major antitrust problem” — as the U.S. Justice Department’s next competition chief.

The White House announced today that it had selected Makan Delrahim, who is already aiding the Trump administration, as its pick to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust, a key government position with the power to approve or deny mergers and investigate companies for potential competition threats.

Delrahim, who must be confirmed by the Senate, is a longtime antitrust expert who previously served in a similar capacity at the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush. In recent months, Delrahim has helped Trump advance his nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, through his own Senate vote.

But Delrahim’s selection stands in contrast with his boss in the Oval Office when it comes to one of the most prominent competition issues currently in the hands of government regulators: The AT&T-Time Warner merger.

Publicly and privately, Trump has blasted the deal, even though the president stressed in January that he hadn’t “seen any of the facts.” Delrahim, however, said in an interview on Canadian television last year that he didn’t see the problem with AT&T’s latest business gambit, given that the wireless giant and Time Warner are not direct competitors.

“The sheer size of it, and the fact that it’s media, I think will get a lot of attention,” he said in October. “However, I don’t see this as a major antitrust problem.”

If he’s confirmed for the job, Delrahim, a former partner at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, will have to work with the government’s ethics watchdogs to set out a plan for when he has to recuse himself.

He has previously worked with AT&T, as a lobbyist for the company from 2007 to 2008, but he has also opposed the telecom giant, as a lawyer who fought AT&T’s unsuccessful bid to buy T-Mobile on behalf of companies like Dish. Delrahim also previously represented Google when the company purchased DoubleClick in 2008, according to his former law firm bio.

Before joining the White House this year, Delrahim served as an antitrust lobbyist for Comcast*, which purchased NBCUniversal in 2011, and he also worked the halls of Congress and the federal government on behalf of Qualcomm, federal records show. His representation of the chipmaker until the end of 2016 — a stint focused on “issues related to domestic and foreign antitrust enforcement,” according to an ethics report — comes as the FTC this year has sued the company for alleged anticompetitive licensing practices.

71,"Washington, D.C. – In the midst of a national financial catastrophe, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) used her position as a senior member of Congress and member of the House Financial Services Committee to prevail upon Treasury officials to meet with OneUnited Bank. She never disclosed that her husband held stock in the bank. This outrageous conduct has led Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) to include the congresswoman as one of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress. Click here to read the full report on Rep. Waters.

“By contacting then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to request a meeting, allegedly for a group of minority-owned banks, but then arranging for only one bank – OneUnited, in which she had a financial interest – to attend, Rep. Waters violated House conflict of interest rules,” said CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan.

Around the same time Rep. Waters asked the Treasury Department to hold the initial meeting, Rep. Waters spoke to Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) about OneUnited, telling him that her husband previously had served on the board. Rep. Frank advised her to stay out of matters related to the bank. Nevertheless, Rep. Waters’ chief of staff and grandson, Mikael Moore, continued to actively assist OneUnited representatives in their quest to receive bailout funds, and worked to craft legislation authorizing Treasury to grant OneUnited’s request.

Rep. Waters was scheduled for an ethics trial on November 29, 2010, but the House Ethics Committee postponed the hearing. Inconsistent reports have emerged suggesting both potential new evidence and serious misconduct by two of the committee’s attorneys and improper conduct by committee members. In July 2011, the committee hired respected D.C attorney Billy Martin as outside counsel to investigate both the case against Rep. Waters and the committee itself.

“The ethics committee has handled the case against Rep. Waters with the maturity of school children,” said Ms. Sloan. “Happily, adult supervision in the form of Mr. Martin has been brought in to clean up the mess.”

72,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas has drawn his first opponent for his bid to run for a second term in the Senate, according to the Houston Chronicle. His name is Rep. Beto O’Rourke, R-Texas, who has an unusual resume, to say the least. While in college O’Rourke played in several punk rock bands. He won his House seat in 2012 by unexpectedly beating the preferred Democratic candidate, Silvestre Reyes, the incumbent in a primary upset. He has since bucked the Democratic leadership in the House, declining to vote for Nancy Pelosi as party leader for example.

On most issues, O’Rourke is decidedly on the left, hewing to an open borders stance as opposed to Cruz’s immigration hawkishness.

He also proposed a special “war tax” to pay for veteran’s care programs. He is, however, well liked by his fellow members of Congress of both parties.

That O’Rourke starts as an underdog is to put the matter mildly. First, he is not likely to be the only Democrat running for the Senate in 2018. Julian Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is said to have senatorial ambitions and has more of a national following and is more of a party man than is O’Rourke.

Then the congressman would have to face Cruz, an influential, national figure with deep support inside Texas and access to lots of cash. Despite the hope over experience analysis by some in the media, Texas remains a deeply red state where no Democrat has won statewide since 1994. Despite talk of “changing demographics” that phenomenon has not translated into support for Democrats in the Lone Star State.

Democrats also have to defend 25 Senate seats in 2018, at least 10 of which are very vulnerable. It is not likely that the national party is going to give much support to a quixotic campaign to knock off Ted Cruz.

Cruz’s run for the presidency last year did not end well for him and resulted in lots of acrimony between himself and President Donald Trump. But that rift seems to have been repaired, for the most part, so that Cruz will likely get warm support from the president, if only from the politically practical reasons for retaining and expanding control of the Senate.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/62d67p/can_a_former_punk_rocker_congressman_take_ted/,us.blastingnews.com

A US federal judge in Hawaii has indefinitely extended the suspension of President Trump's new travel ban.

Judge Derrick Watson's ruling means Mr Trump will be barred from enforcing the ban on six mostly Muslim nations while it is contested in court.

In a lawsuit, the US state says the ban would harm tourism and the ability to recruit foreign students and workers.

President Trump says his revised travel ban seeks to prevent terrorists from entering the United States.

The US Department of Justice said it would appeal against the ruling.

Image copyright AP Image caption Judge Watson turned his earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction

Judge Watson made the ruling late on Wednesday after hearing arguments from attorneys for the state of Hawaii and the US Department of Justice.

The judge turned his earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction that would have a more lasting effect.

President Trump's executive order on 6 March would have placed a 90-day ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees.

An earlier version of the order, issued in late January, sparked confusion and protests, and was blocked by a judge in Seattle.

Other courts across the US have issued different rulings on Mr Trump's revised ban, with a judge in Maryland halting a part of the ban earlier this month.

Mr Trump has complained of ""unprecedented judicial overreach"", pledging to take the case ""as far as it needs to go"".

An appeal against the Hawaii decision would be expected to go next to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals - the same court which in February said it would not block a ruling by a Seattle court to halt the original travel ban.

Five questions on new US travel ban

Who does the travel ban affect?

Under the revised order, citizens of six countries on the original 27 January order - Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - would once more be subject to a 90-day travel ban.

74,"Now might be a good time to revisit some of the grand and inspiring rhetoric with which Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015. “I’ve watched the politicians,” Trump said then. “I’ve dealt with them all. If you can’t make a good deal with a politician, then there’s something wrong with you. You’re certainly not very good.”

Or maybe we should go back to the first Republican debate in Cleveland, when Trump flatly asserted, “Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid,” while eight of those politicians stood mute onstage and grinned stupidly, because everybody knew Trump couldn’t really be the nominee anyway, so why make a whole big scene by refusing to be bullied and berated.

You’ve got to wonder if some of those guys took just a little satisfaction last week in watching Trump fail to cut a deal with his own party on health care. You have to imagine that Jeb Bush or John Kasich was sitting in front of the TV thinking to himself: “Welcome to the NFL, genius.”

Because right about now it should be dawning on Trump that politics isn’t just business for stupid people. There’s a reason so little gets done.

I’m not saying Trump doesn’t bring undervalued skills to the presidency, because he does. A guy who’s put together megadeals in real estate or entertainment is going to come at a political problem more strategically and maybe more pragmatically than some of the career legislators I’ve known, who probably couldn’t win a negotiation over bedtime with my 9-year-old.

But anyone who’s had considerable success in both business and politics — and I spoke to a few leaders like that this week — could have told Trump that ramming legislation through Congress isn’t the same thing as raising up a casino or a high-rise. The principles that work in one arena don’t necessarily translate to the other.

In real estate, even a deal that’s unusually complex is a relatively straightforward proposition. Everybody wants to make money — either off selling land or developing it. Everybody has something the other guy wants. You negotiate your way to the bottom of the market, and then you run the numbers.

There’s always another house, or tract of land, or car — that’s the psychology behind all smart business negotiation. If you’re not willing to set your final terms and walk away, you’re not coming out a winner.

A negotiation like the one Trump just bungled, though, is more like buying a building from a small army of owners rather than one or two, and all of them split into factions that have entirely different agendas.

“You’ve got to get 218 votes, and any individual or small group can be a holdup or pop up with some new requirement,” Mark Warner, who made a fortune off mobile phones before becoming Virginia’s governor and then senator, told me. “It’s a little like whack-a-mole.”

In politics, there isn’t always — or ever — another Congress you can turn to. It’s this law or no law, which means you can’t just lay down your terms and walk away, as Trump tried to do. You have to keep coming back at it, and you have to realize that some of the factions may have zero interest in getting to yes, which is really never true in a business negotiation.

As Johnny Isakson, a senator who built a real estate business in Georgia, puts it: “I sold thousands of houses over the years, and I never sold a house to someone who didn’t want to buy it, and I never bought a house from someone who didn’t want to sell.”

In business, your leverage is always the money you bring to the table or some essential resource you control. In Congress, especially in the age after earmarks, the only real pressure you bring to bear as president is the public will.

You can’t do much cajoling or threatening of reluctant legislators if you’re boasting a 36 percent approval rating, and you can’t just call up the public approval bank and borrow another 10 points at a discounted rate.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/62d75w/trump_fails_at_the_art_of_the_political_deal/,yahoo.com

77,"A single court in rural East Texas has become the site of one of the biggest battles in Silicon Valley.

Tech giants like Intel and Apple say the Eastern District of Texas, within the federal 5th Circuit, has become a haven for frivolous patent lawsuits, with favorable rulings often handed down to litigants that would lose elsewhere in the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

In 2015, 43.6 percent of all U.S. patent cases were filed in the East Texas court, located far from the nation’s tech hubs.

Those tech companies are now taking the issue to the Supreme Court, filing legal briefs in a separate patent lawsuit before the justices.

But other major players in the industry, including Ericsson, are lining up on the opposite side, defending the Texas court and its right to hear patent cases.

The divide has made the case TC Heartland v. Kraft Heinz crucial for the tech industry.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Monday and a ruling is expected this summer.

In the case, Kraft filed a patent infringement suit against Heartland, which makes zero-calorie sweeteners, claiming its Refreshe brand copied Kraft’s MiO product. Kraft filed the suit in federal court in Delaware, but Heartland sought to move it to Indiana, its home state. Heartland noted that it sells few of its products in Delaware and has no offices there.

But federal courts generally give companies broad discretion in picking the court venue or forum where they take their case, usually allowing any district in which a product is sold.

A lower court denied Heartland’s request, which the company is appealing at the Supreme Court.

A case pitting two food companies against each other seems an unlikely lawsuit to spark the interest of Silicon Valley. The question of where patent suits can be filed, though, is one with high stakes for the industry.

Critics say that so-called patent trolls, companies that hold patents but don’t manufacture any products themselves, have flocked to the Eastern District of Texas, filing cases and winning big-dollar judgments.

A ruling for Heartland could boost Silicon Valley and make it easier for them to move patent lawsuits to federal courts in California and other states.

The fight has left tech companies divided.

Companies such as Dell, Oracle, Intel and Adobe have all filed briefs in support of Heartland.

“Forum shopping is a particularly egregious strategy patent trolls use to tip the scales of justice in their favor,” said Abigail Slater, general counsel at the Internet Association, a trade group including Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, which filed a brief.

“By selecting sympathetic courts, trolls are able to extract increased settlements from innocent businesses, large and small.”

But other tech companies, including Ericsson, want judges to keep the current rules in place.

They say it’s good to have one court handle a number of patent cases, arguing that court would have expertise in dealing with those issues.

“Patent cases are complex, and the courts that hear most of them — including the Eastern District of Texas — have become particularly skilled at patent law,” Ericsson wrote in its brief.

That argument also has strong support from drugmakers that have sought to consolidate medical patent cases in a few courts.

They note that retired Judge T. John Ward of the Eastern District created rules to streamline the patent litigation process, limiting the length of proceedings and the size of filings.

But tech companies on the other side aren’t sold. They say current rules give those filing lawsuits an unfair advantage to pick favorable courts.

“Litigants have few tools to check forum-shopping. Defendants ... are rarely able to move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, even if they have few contacts with a forum,” the Business Software Alliance, a trade association, wrote in its brief.

Highlighting the divide, some tech trade groups declined to comment on the issue, noting that their members are on opposite sides.

During Monday’s hearing, the justices directly raised the issue of the Texas court.

Kraft’s lawyers tried to argue that tech patent cases weren’t relevant, but Justice Elena -Kagan dismissed that idea.

“The complaint is that it allows a kind of forum shopping, right? That it — you — lets you go down to Texas where we can get the benefit of a certain set of rules,” she said.

Kagan noted an earlier decision that said lawsuits could be filed where defendants were incorporated.

“For 30 years, the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision and the law has effectively been otherwise,” she said.

Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned the role of “generous jury verdicts” in the debate.

The fight also has the attention of Washington, where both parties have pushed for patent reform in recent years.

Former President Obama called patent trolls one of the “biggest” problems facing tech.

“That district in Texas has been a major preferential district for one side. It’s clearly biased and clearly not run correctly,” he told The Hill on Tuesday.

But Hatch said he had no plans for legislation, and efforts at patent reform have stalled in recent years.

78,"The market dumped last Tuesday. For a good graphical representation, look at the three-day chart of the S&P 500 I keep on my desktop.

Mauldin Economics

You can see a pretty radical change in price action from one day to the next.

What happened?

The job of financial journalism is to try to explain the day-to-day variations in the stock market. Oftentimes, there is nothing to report—lots of randomness. This time, on the other hand, stocks went down hard—so there must be a story behind it.

The Repeal That Wasn't

The best explanation as to why stocks dumped on Tuesday is because it became increasingly unlikely that the ""repeal and replace"" of the Affordable Care Act would pass.

That means the market doesn't get the tax cut. And the market cares about tax cuts.

This is going to cripple the Trump administration politically and delay a complete tax reform package even further, possibly into next year—if it happens at all.

Remember, the whole reason that the market ran up after the election was because Trump was this can-do businessman, capitalist president, who was going to cut corporate and marginal rates to the bone.

That is looking less and less likely. Maybe even impossible.

Missed Opportunities

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin (R) listens to U.S. President Donald Trump speak during a ""strategic initiatives"" lunch at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 22, 2017. Reuters/Kevin Lamarque I have been telling people (privately) that it was a big mistake for the Trump administration not to pursue tax reform first. Instead, we issued a couple of ham-handed executive orders that pissed everyone off and lost a lot of political capital, and then dove into the hornets' nest of healthcare.

It's odd—this group of people who were pretty smart about winning the election are turning out to be pretty dumb about legislative priorities.

Worse, both Trump and Mnuchin have said that people can use the stock market as a yardstick of the administration's performance.

Oops.

But the reality is, the stock market continues to be a good yardstick of their performance—and the judgment is negative.

Where is the Trump Rally Headed?

Investors got too enthusiastic about what Trump was capable of, bid up asset prices to unsustainable heights, and now that reality is settling in, stocks are going to have to find fair value. It might be a lot lower than here.

Because the reality is, if you can't get tax cuts passed under Donald Trump—when can you get them passed?

What I have said repeatedly in The 10 th Man is that the danger to the Trump rally was Trump himself. I have talked for a while about ""good Trump"" and ""bad Trump,"" and since the inauguration, we've mostly had bad Trump.

Should we really be surprised? Trump never campaigned as a Reagan/Laffer supply-side tax cutter. Never did. He campaigned as a fire-breathing populist.

So why is everyone shocked when he turned out to be a fire-breathing populist after being sworn in? It seems as though investors collectively convinced themselves that Trump was something he was not.

Not that I think Trump wouldn't eventually get around to cutting taxes. He would. It's just not his top priority.

So I think everyone pretty much knew this healthcare vote was not going to go well.

Now what?

The stock market doesn't like ""Now what?"" It doesn't do well with open-ended risk. I think, at a minimum, the market could give back the gains since the election. That takes you back to 2100 in the S&P. That's more than a 10% move—and it will feel worse than that.

Newly elected Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez asked for the entire staff of the party organization to submit resignations by April 15 as the DNC attempts a makeover following the 2016 election cycle that left many in the party jaded not only about Democrats’ electoral prospects, but the party’s campaign competency. As part of an effort to actually start winning elections again, establishment Democrats in Washington, D.C. promised change was coming after the party was again unable to win back majorities in either the House or Senate, and pretty much bungled its handling of just about everything having to do with the presidential election.

The staffing overhaul did not come as a surprise as both parties’ national organizations largely operate as fundraising and campaigning apparatuses whose staffing needs and numbers ebb and flow with the tides of the campaign cycle. Not to mention, given the party wreckage after the tumultuous term of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whose Clinton ties rankled Bernie Sanders supporters, followed by interim chair Donna Brazille, and now Perez, charting a new course with fresh faces and new blood isn’t just a political strategy—it’s a mandate from the rank and file.

A federal RFRA signed by President Clinton in 1993 shares language with Indiana and other states' bills, prohibiting the government from ""substantially burdening"" individuals' exercise of religion unless it is for a ""compelling government interest"" and is doing so in the least restrictive means.

[Indiana is the battle over religious freedom that Arizona never was]

The fact that legislation like this is so widespread probably gave Pence some confidence in signing the bill, despite the controversy in Arizona last year over its bill that was ultimately scrapped, and in other states, like Georgia, which are considering similar measures this year (the NCSL found 13 additional states are considering their own RFRA legislation).

Pence has begun to feel the fallout from his decision. But while Indiana is being criticized, the NCAA didn't say it was concerned over how athletes and employees would be affected by Kentucky's RFRA when games were played there last week, there aren't any plans to boycott states like Illinois or Connecticut, and Miley Cyrus has yet to post a photo of President Clinton or any of the 19 other governors who have also signed RFRAs.

Indiana might be treated as if it's the only state with a bill like this, but it's not.

82,"The sheer level of willful deception and calculated, propagated ignorance of the actual content and scope of any Restoration of Freedom of Religion Act is astonishing, which others have chronicled far better than I. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook throws his emotional nonsense op-ed in the ring today, declaring religious liberty protections that exist in 30 states “dangerous,” and the sure path to a semblance of “days of segregation and discrimination marked by ‘Whites Only’ signs on shop doors, water fountains and restrooms.”

Cook, of course, does not note that in the years these laws have existed, no on has every successfully used this process of appealing the government “successfully to defend anti-gay discrimination, not in twenty years of RFRAs nationwide.” That would require dealing honestly and intelligently with the law’s content, which is what Gabriel Malor did in his Federalist piece and John McCormack has done, here.

Indiana’s RFRA does not grant a license to discriminate. First of all, the state of Indiana, like 28 other states, has never prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation at public accommodations. Even without such laws in most states, discrimination doesn’t commonly occur because the United States is a nation that is tolerant of gay people and intolerant of bigots. Mean-spirited actions by a business owner anywhere in the country would almost certainly be met with a major backlash. It is true that several local ordinances in Indiana prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but RFRA does not declare that those ordinances are invalid if someone requests a religious exemption. Again, RFRA simply establishes the balancing test courts must apply in religious freedom cases.

But back to Cook, who offers this clarion call.

Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination.

Super. Now we know that Cook’s ignorance applies, not just to state and federal laws in the U.S., but to laws in the other countries where Apple does business. As Allahpundit pointed out on Twitter:

Ryan Anderson dings Apple for engaging in the, ahem, “discrimination” it would like to make illegal for others:

Apple itself has exercised this freedom (or is the proper word, according to Cook, “discrimination”?). After all, Apple removed the Manhattan Declaration app from its App Store. Apple decided that a Christian app bearing witness to the dignity of unborn life, the nature of marriage as the union of husband and wife and the centrality of religious liberty was incompatible with its mission. So they “discriminated” against the Manhattan Declaration. No one suggested that this should be made illegal. Even if we thought it a misguided decision, we thought Apple should be free to decide its own values and live according to them.

Salesforce is another company gravely concerned about Indiana, but not sufficiently concerned about China’s human rights abuses to pull out of that country.

Mollie Hemingway, who has much done heavy lifting on the pushback against this overblown outrage, has my favorite piece on RFRAs: Meet 10 Americans Helped By Religious Freedom Bills Like Indiana’s. A taste of just two of these cases:

1) Most recent RFRA winner: Lipan Apache religious leader Robert Soto Just a few weeks ago, on March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers it had seized nine years prior from a Native American religious leader and famed feather dancer Robert Soto. He had appealed the seizure of the eagle feathers, for which he faced 15 years in a federal penitentiary and a $250,000 fine, on Religious Freedom Restoration Act grounds. The feds had sent undercover agents to a powwow in 2006 to confiscate the feathers, which are central to Soto’s Native American faith. The federal government prohibits possession of eagle feathers without a permit and only grants permits to museums, scientists, zoos, farmers, large power companies and federally recognized tribes. Even though the Lipan Apaches are recognized by the State of Texas, historians and sociologists, they’re not recognized by the feds. 2) An arbitrary ban: Sikh federal employee Kawal Tagore After being baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore began carrying a kirpan, “an emblem resembling a small knife with a blunt, curved blade” that reminds Sikhs of their commitment to justice. It’s one of five articles of faith baptized Sikhs are supposed to carry. She was told to go home from her job with the IRS in a federal building in Houston and told not to return. The building allowed scissors, knives, box cutters and other items with far sharper blades than her kirpan, but they wouldn’t let her carry her religiously required emblem. After working from home for nine months, she was fired. She sought protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and on November 4, 2014, the government agreed to settle the case.

Tolerance is giving these people a chance to defend themselves when the government is requiring them to violate their sincerely held beliefs. These cases do not represent some horrible, regressive country giving in to its darkest desires for discrimination. Quite the opposite. They represent the very best of the American experiment, which allows all kinds of people to coexist and do business together without running roughshod over the varied and beautiful customs and religions we practice.

87,"During a tense phone call with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough in early March, Sen. Chuck Schumer delivered a blunt message: He would join a growing chorus of senators defying the wishes of President Barack Obama by demanding that Congress have an official say over any nuclear deal with Iran.

But in a nod to the president, Schumer later made clear that he would give administration officials more time to negotiate a nuclear pact before pushing forward with a congressional review bill.

Story Continued Below

The conversations underscored the unusually conflicted — yet increasingly influential — role Schumer is playing as the Iran talks approach a critical juncture. The New York Democrat was already among a handful of senators with the power to undermine or even scuttle a nuclear agreement. Then on Friday, he became the Democratic leader-in-waiting following Sen. Harry Reid’s retirement announcement.

Now senators on both sides of the aisle will be watching Schumer — closely — to see how he responds to any deal.

As a leading pro-Israel voice among Senate Democrats, Schumer is at odds with the White House on Iran, yet he also needs to maintain good relations with Obama. He has to balance his own views on the negotiations with those of a Senate Democratic Caucus that is, by and large, eager to avoid conflict with Iran and stand with the president. Further complicating the matter is a home-state constituency with very strong feelings about Israel and the threat posed to it by Iran.

“It’s obvious that he has a very real, pro-Israel constituency,” said Sen. John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman and a friend of Schumer’s. “Yet at the same time, he has loyalty to the president. So he has to balance those.”

Indeed, the Iran deal is a key early test for the New Yorker as he works to solidify his standing as Reid’s heir apparent. Schumer has long been reluctant to take assertive positions when his caucus is divided. But the prominent Jewish Democrat — he will be the first person of his faith to serve as a Senate party leader — may have to if a deal is clinched and faces a backlash from the powerful pro-Israel lobby.

Schumer is widely seen as a barometer of whether the White House will have enough support on Capitol Hill to sustain a veto on a bill by Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) requiring that Congress review any Iran agreement. The view is that if Schumer pushes hard for the Corker-Menendez plan, it will almost certainly clear the 67 votes needed to override a veto, since having him publicly call for the proposal gives other Democrats the political cover to break with Obama on the issue.

Adding to his role is the likelihood that Menendez will be indicted soon on federal corruption charges, potentially sidelining him in the debate. The New Jersey senator is the other leading Democratic hawk defending Israel.

“Schumer has played a pretty pivotal role in making sure we keep our unity in the Senate,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s been very clear as to what his position is. On the other hand, he’s been able to help us get through the stage of negotiations we’re in, to deal with the administration and to be sensitive to the negotiations.”

Schumer — who believes the Iran legislation is a “backstop” to prevent a bad deal from being enacted — declined to be interviewed for this story.

Even as some Democrats have been eager to break ranks with the White House, Schumer has helped keep restive Senate Democrats at bay. He helped spearhead letters with Menendez saying his party would hold off on backing new legislative action — such as the congressional review bill or new sanctions on Iran — until after the March 31 negotiating deadline set by Obama.

In caucus meetings with Senate Democrats, Schumer has largely avoided talking about the Iran negotiations. He has expressed some skepticism of the details of the talks in private discussions with fellow Democratic leaders and has had sharp words for some members of the Obama administration about their dealings with Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

At a private dinner earlier this year with other senators, Schumer told Secretary of State John Kerry “even if you think Netanyahu has been wrong, poking Israel back in the eye doesn’t help,” according to a source familiar with the comments. He has also conveyed that message to McDonough, the person said.

And in a private call to Netanyahu before his recent speech to Congress on Iran, Schumer warned the prime minister against inflaming partisan tensions and raised concerns about the fact that the foreign leader spoke without the White House’s consent.

However, Schumer attended the Netanyahu speech, even as dozens of his Democratic colleagues boycotted it.

Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said Schumer is “in a tough spot” on Iran.

“New York is the mother ship of the American Jewish community,” said Kirk, a lead sponsor of another bill to impose new sanctions on Iran.

Schumer is also close with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby that has raised serious concerns about the emerging deal with Iran and six world powers, including the United States.

If the White House reaches an agreement with Iran, it is bound to face pressure in Congress when the Senate returns from a two-week recess in mid-April. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled an April 14 committee vote on the Corker-Menendez bill, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to bring it to the floor soon after that. The measure, which would require congressional review of the Iran deal, would also prohibit the president from suspending congressional sanctions on Iran for 60 days while Congress scrutinizes the agreement. It would also require that Obama report to Congress on Iran’s compliance with the deal every three months.

The White House says the bill is an unacceptable infringement on the president’s role as commander in chief.

“This is a purview that’s been part of the executive branch for decades and the president retains the authority to conduct foreign policy,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Monday.

Despite the White House’s position, Schumer officially signed on to the Corker-Menendez bill on Thursday, when the Senate was engaged in a lengthy voting session over the budget. It is very close to gaining enough support to surmount a veto. The issue is causing tension between Schumer and White House officials, who are communicating frequently about the matter.

One person familiar with the early March phone call between Schumer and McDonough said the conversation was “very, very heated.” A White House official disagreed with that characterization but declined further comment.

“He is certainly a hawk [on Israel], that has not changed,” said a person close to Schumer. “But he is trying to keep an open line of communication with the administration. He’s trying to let them know what’s going on. There’s certainly been some very tense moments in that part of the process. He’s trying to be firm but open with them.”",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/30wzud/iran_deal_a_big_test_for_schumer_the_democratic/,politico.com
88,"Indiana governor Mike Pence

A calm look at Indiana’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act and its precedents.

Last week, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana signed into law the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Almost immediately, an uproar ensued, claiming that the law was discriminatory — that it provided a license for businesses to discriminate against gay and lesbian customers. Entirely lost in this kerfuffle has been the simple fact that the Indiana law is modeled on the 1993 federal law of the same name, and that counterparts have been adopted in 19 other states. Further, four federal courts of appeals and the Obama Justice Department have all taken the position that RFRA can be used as a defense in private suits involving the enforcement of laws that substantially burden free exercise of religion. Important debates over the intersection of faith and equality are impaired when they are overtaken by misguided rhetoric, rather than being informed by the history and context of how our legal system has treated this issue.

EDITORIAL: Liberals Against Religious Freedom in Indiana

The story of RFRA begins in 1990. Alfred Smith ingested peyote — a powerful hallucinogen — in the course of his Native American religious ceremonies. Smith was terminated by his employer due to the Peyote ritual. Smith challenged the subsequent denial of unemployment benefits — based on the drug use — as a violation of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause. In a controversial decision by Justice Antonin Scalia in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court held that the Free Exercise Clause could not be raised as a defense against a law of general applicability.

This opinion generated an immediate backlash: How could a person be punished for exercising his sincerely held religious beliefs? In 1993, then-Representative Charles Schumer of New York introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the House of Representatives. Its counterpart bill in the Senate was co-sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy. The bill enjoyed such wide-ranging bipartisan support that it passed the House on a voice vote, passed the Senate by a vote of 97 to 3, and was promptly signed into law by President Clinton. (Imagine such a significant law passing today with this kind of vote!)

The law states that the federal “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it “is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” At a minimum, RFRA attempted to reverse the Court’s construction of the Free Exercise clause in the Smith case.

The scope of RFRA was clarified last year by the Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. The High Court found that the federal government could not mandate that Hobby Lobby offer its employees health insurance that would pay for certain emergency contraceptives. Unresolved by that decision, however, was whether the RFRA defense applies in private suits, not involving the government.

The relief provision of RFRA provides that “A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” The use of the passive voice — “whose religious exercise has been burdened” — elides who is imposing the burden: the government, or private parties enforcing federal law. This language can be read two ways: first, RFRA can be asserted only to “obtain appropriate relief against” the government; second, RFRA can be raised as a “defense” whenever “religious exercise has been burdened” in any “judicial proceeding,” whether against the government, or a private party.

This provision has caused a split among the federal courts of appeals. The majority of circuits that have confronted this issue have held that the language allows a defendant to assert RFRA as a “defense” in a private cause of action not involving the government. Even though the suit is brought by a private party, the argument goes, the “religious exercise” is still being burdened through the enforcement of a federal law in “a judicial proceeding.”

As Shruti Chaganti explained in a 2013 article in the Virginia Law Review, the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals — which Chaganti dubbed the “defense circuits” — have allowed RFRA to be raised as a defense in a private suit, “finding the statute’s language and purpose sufficiently broad to create a defense regardless of the parties to the suit.”

In 1996 — three years after RFRA was enacted — the D.C. Circuit held that the Catholic University of America could raise RFRA as a defense against a sex-discrimination claim brought by a nun and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alike. In 1998, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a church could assert RFRA as a defense against a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings. In a 2000 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, one church sued another church for unlawfully using materials copyrighted by its late pastor. The court allowed the infringing church to raise the defense, but found that the application of the copyright law did not impose a “substantial burden” on its exercise of religion.

In a 2005 decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, a priest was forced into retirement by the New York Methodist Church when he turned 70. The priest brought an age-discrimination claim, and the church countered that enforcing the law would burden its free exercise. The Second Circuit found that “RFRA’s language surely seems broad enough to encompass” the church’s raising RFRA as a defense against the age-discrimination claim. In short, Judge Ralph Winter wrote, RFRA “easily covers” the church’s claim that applying the anti-discrimination law would “substantially burden” its exercise of religion.

These four cases, and many others, concerned similar facts — private parties had brought suits against corporations. (Yes, Catholic University and Catholic churches are corporations . ) In each case, the corporate defendants were allowed to raise RFRA as a defense to assert that the enforcement of a federal law — Title VII’s prohibition against discrimination, bankruptcy law, and even copyright law — would burden their free exercise of religion. In some cases, the defenses were successful, and in others they were not. But this is the rule of law in the states under the jurisdiction of these four circuits — nearly half the states in the union. Until recently, this was not particularly controversial.

But not all judges agree. Taking the opposing view was then–Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor — now a Supreme Court justice — who dissented in the Methodist Church case. She found that RFRA “does not apply to disputes between private parties.” Judge Winter responded forcefully to Sotomayor’s suggestion: “The [dissent’s] narrowing interpretation — permitting the assertion of RFRA as a defense only when relief is also sought against a governmental party — involves a convoluted drawing of a hardly inevitable negative implication. If such a limitation was intended, Congress chose a most awkward way of inserting it.” Joining Judge’s Sotomayor’s dissenting view, however, are the Sixth and Seventh Circuit Courts of Appeals. Chaganti dubs these courts the “non-defense circuits,” as they have held that RFRA was meant to “provide a defense only when obtaining appropriate relief against a government and therefore cannot apply to suits in which the government is not a party.”

Advertisement

In 2010, the Sixth Circuit Court found that the “Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church” could not raise RFRA as a defense in a trademark infringement suit brought by the “Seventh-Day Adventist Church.”

In 2006, the ubiquitous Judge Richard Posner weighed in on this issue for the Seventh Circuit. In an age-discrimination claim brought by a organist against the Catholic Diocese of Peoria, Posner wrote that “RFRA is applicable only to suits to which the government is a party.” The Supreme Court in 2012 unanimously and expressly reversed Posner’s opinion on other grounds in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, finding that the so-called “ministerial exception” to the Free Exercise clause could be raised as an “affirmative defense.” Judge Posner’s RFRA analysis was premised, in part, on the fact that since the Free Exercise Clause does not offer the “ministerial exception” as an affirmative defense, it was “hardly to be imagined” that Congress gave “greater protection to religious autonomy than RFRA does.” Since this predicate of Posner’s ruling was invalidated by the Court, the sustained validity of Judge Posner’s ruling is questionable.

Joining the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits in finding that RFRA can be asserted as a defense in a private cause of action is the Holder Justice Department. In August of 2012, the United States Government stated that Wheaton College, if sued by an employee for failing to provide insurance that covered contraceptives, “in its defense of such an action, would have an opportunity to raise its contention that the contraceptive coverage requirement violates” RFRA. Yes, you read that right. The Obama Administration held that a corporation, albeit a non-profit one, could defend itself against a private claim from an employee by asserting that the Obamacare’s contraception mandate imposes a “substantial burden” on its free exercise of religion. That is to say, the most controversial aspect of the new Indiana religious-freedom law was blessed by Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department. This position is directly at odds with the views of Sotomayor, Posner, and others. Again, none of this was particularly controversial until fairly recently.

Since the enactment of the federal RFRA in 1993, 19 states — including Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina — implemented their own RFRAs, which were very similar to the federal law. The state courts, like the federal courts, have wrestled over whether state RFRAs can be raised as a defense in private suits. Most notable among these decisions is the New Mexico Supreme Court’s opinion in Elane Photography v. Willock. In this now-famous case, a photographer was fined for refusing to photograph a same-sex wedding. The Land of Enchantment’s High Court, mirroring Sotomayor’s and Posner’s narrow reading, concluded that the photographer could not raise the state RFRA as a defense against the discrimination claim. (The Supreme Court of the United States declined to review this case).

This brings us back to the Hoosier State. Section 9 of Indiana’s RFRA provides that “A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.” In the wake of Elane Photography, Indiana made explicit for its own law what the four federal courts of appeals and the Obama Justice Department had already recognized about the federal counterpart. Indiana’s RFRA does no more than codify that the private enforcement of public laws — such as discrimination claims — can be defended if there is a substantial burden on free exercise of religion. That’s it. And again, until recently, this provision was not particularly controversial.

I must stress — and this point has been totally lost in the Indiana debate — that RFRA does not provide immunity to discrimination claims. It only allows a defendant to raise a defense, which a finder of fact must consider, as in any other defense that can be raised under Title VII or the Americans with Disabilities Act. Yes, believe it or not, under employment-discrimination laws, the courts have long recognized that there are legitimate defenses to treating people differently based on protected statuses. In the Supreme Court’s decision in Hosanna-Tabor , mentioned earlier, the Court unanimously found that an employee terminated because of a disability could not sue the church, because of the Free Exercise clause. This may not seem fair or equitable, but this 9–0 decision by the Supreme Court was a recognition of clearly established principles of how religious beliefs can, in rare cases, provide a defense against discrimination claims. University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, an expert in free-exercise law, stated the issue well: “The hysteria over this law is so unjustified. It’s not about discriminating against gays in general or across the board. It’s about not being involved in a ceremony that you believe is inherently religious.” Like the First Amendment, RFRA is not a blank check for bigotry.

In summary, four Courts of Appeals, covering nearly half the states in the Union, and the Obama Justice Department, have stated that RFRA can be asserted as a defense in a private case seeking the enforcement of federal law. As Indiana University law professor Daniel Conkle, a supporter of same-sex marriage, explained, “The proposed Indiana RFRA would provide valuable guidance to Indiana courts, directing them to balance religious freedom against competing interests under the same legal standard that applies throughout most of the land. It is anything but a ‘license to discriminate,’ and it should not be mischaracterized or dismissed on that basis.” In this sense, the Indiana law would operate as does its federal counterpart.

None of this is to say whether allowing RFRA to be raised as a defense in private suits is a good or bad policy. Rather, the moral outrage and proposed boycotts over Indiana’s law reflect an inexcusable failure to put into context how these laws have developed over the last two decades. Public-policy decisions, even those involving the most controversial issues of social justice, should be made on the basis of reasoned debate, rather than inflamed diatribes.

90,"Journalists are whipped by blowing snow as President Obama’s Marine One helicopter takes off on March 6. Under the Obama administration, reporters say, officials generally have been less forthcoming with information and interviews. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

Stacey Singer, a health reporter for the Palm Beach Post in Florida, was perusing a medical journal in 2012 when she came across something startling: a federal epidemiologist’s report about a tuberculosis outbreak in the Jacksonville area. Singer promptly began pursuing the story.

But when she started seeking official comment about the little-reported outbreak, the doors began closing. County health officials referred her to the state health department. State officials referred her to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even though the CDC’s own expert had written the investigative report, the agency’s press office declined to let Singer speak with him. A spokesman told her it was a local matter and sent her back to the state office in Tallahassee.

Through public records requests, Singer eventually was able to piece together the story of a contagion that had caused 13 deaths and 99 illnesses — the worst the CDC had found in 20 years.

“It’s really expensive to fight this hard” for public information, said Singer, now an editorial writer at the newspaper. She suspects that officials were slow to respond because news of the TB outbreak might have harmed Florida’s tourism industry. “They know that to delay is to deny. . . . They know we have to move on to other stories.”

The stories aren’t always as consequential or as dramatic as a TB outbreak, but Singer’s experience is shared by virtually every journalist on the government beat, from the White House on down. They can recite tales with similar outlines: An agency spokesman — frequently a political appointee — rejects the reporter’s request for interviews, offers partial or nonresponsive replies, or delays responding at all until after the journalist’s deadline has passed.

Interview requests that are granted are closely monitored, reporters say, with a press “minder” sitting in. Some agencies require reporters to pose their questions by e-mail, a tactic that enables officials to carefully craft and vet their replies.

Tensions between reporters and public information officers — “hacks and flacks” in the vernacular — aren’t new, of course. Reporters have always wanted more information than government officials have been willing or able to give.

But journalists say the lid has grown tighter under the Obama administration, whose chief executive promised in 2009 to bring “an unprecedented level of openness” to the federal government.

The frustrations boiled over last summer in a letter to President Obama signed by 38 organizations representing journalists and press-freedom advocates. The letter decried “politically driven suppression of news and information about federal agencies” by spokesmen. “We consider these restrictions a form of censorship — an attempt to control what the public is allowed to see and hear,” the groups wrote.

They asked for “a clear directive” from Obama “telling federal employees they’re not only free to answer questions from reporters and the public, but actually encouraged to do so.”

Obama hasn’t acted on the suggestion. But his press secretary, Josh Earnest, defended the president’s record, noting in a letter to the groups that, among other things, the administration has processed a record number of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, established more protection for whistleblowers and posted White House visitor logs for the first time.

“While there is more work to do, the White House and federal agencies are far more accessible and accountable than ever before,” Earnest wrote.

In fact, most federal agencies get subpar grades on one measure of openness: their responsiveness to FOIA requests, which enable reporters and ordinary citizens to collect government records. Eight of the 15 agencies that get the most FOIA requests received a D grade for their compliance, according to a review this month by the nonprofit Center for Effective Government.

Two agencies — Health and Human Services and the State Department — received failing grades.

‘Protected’ information

When Dina Cappiello, until recently the national environment writer for the Associated Press, asked the Interior Department for federal data about bird deaths on wind-energy farms in 2013, she says, she met a stone wall. The industry-supplied information, the agency told her, was “protected” and couldn’t be released because it would harm a private interest.

Cappiello suspected a political motive for the department’s silence: The Obama administration supports the development of wind power, and release of the data might undercut public support if it showed that wind farms kill large numbers of protected species, such as eagles and falcons.

She filed a FOIA request for the records. No dice. “I still haven’t gotten an answer,” she said recently.

The reaction was even more aggressive when Cappiello began asking the Agriculture Department for interviews for a story about the environmental degradation caused by converting non-crop land into cornfields for ethanol production, another administration initiative.

The agency went on the offense, telling officials in the field not to talk to her and her co-writer. A public affairs official further instructed his colleagues not to provide the reporters with the names of farmers for interviews, as they had routinely done for other stories.

“We just want to have a consistent message on the topic,” the official, Jason Johnson, wrote in an e-mail. Cappiello filed another FOIA request for the directive — and noted the e-mail’s existence in her story about the land-conversion policy.

“I think the thread here is that all of these stories are questioning the goals and policies of the administration,” she said. “All of these have the potential to set off controversy.” While government press officials often talk about having “a consistent message,” Cappiello said, “they never seem to insist on having ‘a truthful message.’ I wonder why.”

Other reporters who cover the government express similar concerns. In a survey of 146 such reporters conducted by the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) in 2012, 76 percent said they had to get approval from a public information officer before speaking to an agency employee; two-thirds said they were prohibited by the agency from interviewing an employee at least some of the time.

The vast majority — 85 percent — agreed with this statement: “The public is not getting all the information it needs because of barriers agencies are imposing on journalists’ reporting practices.”

“It happens all the time,” said freelance journalist Kathryn Foxhall, a health and science reporter who has become active in promoting greater access to government information. “It’s as if the public has no right to know what’s going on inside a government agency.”

Many of the roadblocks reporters say they have encountered at the federal level are also familiar to journalists covering smaller communities, according to another SPJ survey, conducted last year.

Linda Petersen, managing editor of the Valley Journals newspapers in the Salt Lake City area, recalled contacting an employee of the parks and recreation department in suburban Riverton, Utah, (pop. 40,921) two years ago and asking when the town’s annual Easter egg hunt would start. He refused to help, she said, telling her, “I’ve been instructed not to talk to a reporter ever about anything.”

Petersen called the designated public information official and got the starting time.

Spokesmen speak out

As for Stacey Singer, the Florida reporter who probed the TB outbreak, CDC spokesman Scott Bryan said by e-mail that the agency turned her away because “questions about TB outbreaks (or possible TB outbreaks) are best addressed by the state or local departments of health in the affected areas. We routinely refer reporters to state or local officials as they are best able to speak to the latest information.”

Public information professionals say the picture isn’t quite as black and white, or as bleak, as reporters make it. They turn the focus back on journalists. For one thing, they say, many of the reporters they deal with are inexperienced and are tackling complicated subjects on tight deadlines — a formula for getting things wrong without the guidance of a communications official who knows his or her agency.

“Reporters are tweeting, reporters are blogging, they’re on Facebook,” said Tom Reynolds, the associate administrator for public affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency. “EPA is a very science-oriented agency, and it takes a lot of time to understand the work we’re doing across the agency. With less-experienced reporters, it takes even more time.”

The EPA’s communication efforts were the target of a complaint from the Society of Environmental Journalists, which criticized the agency’s slow response to media inquiries after a chemical spill fouled the drinking water around Charleston, W.Va., last year. It cited the case of Charleston Gazette reporter Ken Ward Jr., who waited a week to get an official comment from the EPA about the water’s potability amid a crisis affecting 300,000 people.

Reynolds, a former Obama campaign official, said the agency has “made adjustments” to address the issue, including adding five people to its communications staff. “We listened and we responded,” he said.

Ideally, public information officers should be seen as “partners and advocates” for reporters, not as adversaries, said John Verrico, president of the National Association of Government Communicators, a group for government media representatives. “You need to trust that we are getting you complete and accurate information, and we need to trust that you are going to use the information we provide properly and in the context it was intended,” he said.

With both sides warily circling each other, veteran journalists look back on an earlier age and fondly recall how much easier it was to do their jobs.

As a young Newsweek correspondent covering President Gerald Ford in the mid-1970s, Tom DeFrank occasionally stood near the president as he greeted well-wishers on rope lines. On the day would-be assassin Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme fired a shot at Ford in 1975, DeFrank was a few steps behind Ford and ran with the president and his entourage into a building for safety. In the immediate aftermath, he recalls, Ford looked “as white as a ghost.”

That kind of proximity to power is impossible now, said DeFrank, a contributing editor at National Journal. “Access has been shrinking for 25 years, regardless of the president,” he said. “It’s all about controlling the message.”

Trade journalist Jim Dickinson, who has been covering the Food and Drug Administration since 1975, remembers being able to wander the FDA’s halls in search of stories. And he often found important ones — about medical device testing, scientific findings or proposed drug regulations — by popping into offices and talking to government scientists and officials.

These days, Dickinson, the editor of FDA Webview and FDA Review, can’t walk into the agency without an appointment. And he can’t talk to any officials without the consent of the agency’s public information office, which monitors each interview he does.

As a result, Dickinson says, he knows far less today about the inner workings of the FDA than when he was roaming its halls 40 years ago.

And he says the public does, too: “You only get to know what they’re comfortable telling you about it. It’s stultifying.”",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/30ww7u/access_denied_reporters_say_federal_officials/,washingtonpost.com
91,"Since Pence signed it into law on last Thursday, the Religious Freedom Act has come under withering criticism, sparked a boycott of Indiana, and ignited a national debate about whether such legislation sanctions discrimination against homosexuals.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has no problem with Indiana’s Religious Freedom Act.

In a radio interview Monday night with Hugh Hewitt, Bush praised Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for signing the legislation into law.

“I think Governor Pence has done the right thing,” Bush said. “Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to have, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all.”

Since Pence signed it into law on last Thursday, the Religious Freedom Act has come under withering criticism, sparked a boycott of Indiana, and ignited a national debate about whether such legislation sanctions discrimination against homosexuals.

“These bills rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said Monday in an op-ed in The Washington Post. “They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality.

During his interview with Bush, Hewitt said he did not believe that such laws, including one in the nation’s capitol, actually led to discrimination. “I do not know of a single incidence of the sort that Tim Cook was warning about occurring in the District in the last 22 years,” Hewitt said.

Bush then rallied to the defense to those who he said the laws were meant to protect.

“But there are incidents of people who, for example, the florist in Washington state who had a business that based on her conscience, she couldn’t be participating in a gay wedding, organizing it, even though the person, one of the people was a friend of hers. And she was taken to court, and is still in court, or the photographer in New Mexico,” Bush said. “There are many cases where people acting on their conscience have been castigated by the government. And this law simply says the government has to have a level of burden to be able to establish that there’s been some kind of discrimination.”

Bush was not the only Republican mulling a 2016 White House run to rally to Pence’s defense on Monday. Ben Carson called the Indiana law “vital,” while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz issued his own show of support late in the day.

“I want to commend Governor Mike Pence for his support of religious freedom, especially in the face of fierce opposition. There was a time, not too long ago, when defending religious liberty enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Alas, today we are facing a concerted assault on the First Amendment, on the right of every American to seek out and worship God according to the dictates of his or her conscience,” Cruz said in a statement. “Governor Pence is holding the line to protect religious liberty in the Hoosier State. Indiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties. I’m proud to stand with Mike, and I urge Americans to do the same.”

The Indianapolis Star, meanwhile, called on Pence and the state Legislature to formally issue protections to gay and lesbian residents.

“Gov. Mike Pence and the General Assembly need to enact a state law to prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, education and public accommodations on the basis of a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity,” the paper stated.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/30wr7i/jeb_bush_praises_mike_pence_for_religious_freedom/,seattletimes.com

93,"An anti-cop group wants to take its beef with law enforcement to a new level: disarm the New York City Police Department.

“’Disarm NYPD’ is a new collective seeking to immediately stop the New York Police Department from killing anyone… http://t.co/aJ19VrPHMp — Occupy Buffalo (@occupybuf) March 31, 2015

“Disarm NYPD” is teaming up with Copwatch groups—which monitor and record alleged police brutality—to create “no-cop zones” in the city and, ultimately, strip the police of firearms.

A member of Disarm NYPD, who chose to remain anonymous, told Waging Nonviolence Thursday, “We feel that the police have proven that they’re not responsible enough to carry arms due to the fact that they’ve been killing people so consistently for so many decades.

“We feel that they should be disarmed immediately.”

Another community group, Take Back The Bronx, was formed in 2011, and has created “no-cop zones” for a day, where residents were encouraged to to speak up against police and about local issues in a block-party atmosphere.

Disarm NYPD wants to take that idea beyond the Bronx, to all of New York City.

“We’ve all been organizing for years,” said the member of Disarm NYPD. “After Ferguson, we got really inspired and started organizing during the demonstrations. And we figured — since it’s getting warm, and especially since that Ferguson report came out — that we need to start taking more action. We can’t let things fall apart. We have to keep the pressure on the police.”

A disarmed NYPD and no-cop zones? What could go wrong?

“Oh, I laughed. I laughed. I laughed.

Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill requiring abortion providers to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic) Story Highlights In a statement, Ducey said the legislation ""protects Arizona taxpayers"" in ensuring public funds are ""not used to subsidize abortions through Arizona's health care exchange

Bill opponents have said their science does not support the claim that drug-induced abortions can be reversed

With Ducey's signatature, the legislation was a win the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, which has made the bill one of its key issues for the 2015 session

Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday signed into law a bill that requires physicians to tell women receiving medication-induced abortions that the procedure can potentially be reversed.

Senate Bill 1318 also bars insurance companies from providing abortion services to women who purchase medical coverage through the federal health-care exchange, except in cases of rape and incest.

In a statement, Ducey said the legislation ""protects Arizona taxpayers"" by ensuring public funds are ""not used to subsidize abortions.""

""The American people overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortions, and it's no different in Arizona, where we have long-standing policy against subsidizing them with public dollars,"" Ducey's statement said.

The bill signing came as lawmakers returned from a weekend break to packed agendas.

The Senate promptly killed two of the most controversial bills of the session, rejecting measures that would allow guns in public buildings and that would end Arizona's compliance with the Common Core education standards. But the rush to end the session by week's end seemed to slow, with many lawmakers and Capitol observers projecting final adjournment next week.

PREVIOUS: Arizona House approves abortion restrictions

The abortion legislation was a win for the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, which had made the bill one of its key issues for the 2015 session.

The powerful group, led by Ducey campaign supporter and lobbyist Cathi Herrod, has worked over the years to restrict abortions.

The group tweeted a photo of Ducey signing the bill at his desk in the Executive Tower.

Herrod told The Arizona Republic that the group was provided with the photo by someone in the room.

Herrod called it ""a good day for Arizona women when the law ensures women"" are told such medication-induced abortions may be reversible.

Bill opponents have said medical science does not support the claim that drug-induced abortions can be reversed. The notification language, proposed by Rep. Kelly Townsend, R-Gilbert, drew ridicule from critics nationwide.

The underlying bill will make it more expensive for a woman to find insurance coverage that pays for elective abortion services, said Cynde Cerf of Planned Parenthood of Arizona.

""If you're a woman who relies on the (health-care) marketplace, it's less expensive,"" Cerf said.

Now, women will turn to private insurance or perhaps their employers' plans, she added.

The bill also requires doctors who provide abortions to submit proof to the state Department of Health Services of the hospitals where they have admitting privileges.

The measure was amended last week to keep those records shielded from public view, out of concern for the doctors' safety.

Herrod said Ducey's signature on the bill underscores his statement that ""he was proudly pro-life.""

""Governor Ducey is a man of his word. He never shied or backed away from being pro-life, so it's no surprise he would sign pro-life legislation,"" Herrod said.

98,"But the terrain is tricky: Mr. Clinton is never as enraged or unpredictable as when his wife comes under attack. He will also remain focused on the Clinton Foundation, which has come under criticism for its fund-raising practices. (While Mrs. Clinton is likely to be campaigning in the next several months, Mr. Clinton will have a packed schedule of foundation-related events, including a big trip to Africa with supporters of his charity.) He runs the risk of reinforcing a Republican argument that the Clintons are America’s baby boomer past and do not represent a generational change in leadership. And he remains a wild card: What part would he play if he returned to the White House as first gentleman?

“I can’t think of anything tougher than being him in Secretary Clinton’s presidential campaign, because no matter what he does, people will take exception to it,” said Jerry Crawford, who was Mrs. Clinton’s Midwest co-chairman in 2008 and Mr. Clinton’s Iowa state director in 1992 and 1996.

“But at the same time, who would you rather have as a messenger and a strategist?” added Mr. Crawford, who speaks to the Clintons regularly. “And he learned a lot in 2008. First and foremost, he found out the last time how hard it is to be objective when it’s your spouse running.”

In the years since the bruising 2008 primary campaign, Mr. Clinton has regained his image as a Democratic stalwart, particularly by being a devoted surrogate to Mr. Obama and delivering a much-praised speech at the party’s convention in 2012. Fifty-six percent of Americans have a positive opinion of Mr. Clinton, making him more popular than both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, according to a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll released this month. Mr. Clinton’s state of mind these days, according to people who are associated with him, can be summed up as Zen and jolly.

Mr. Clinton has also brushed up on how modern campaigns are waged. “The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,” a 2012 book by Sasha Issenberg about how data and analytics have upended presidential campaigns, caught Mr. Clinton’s eye in an article he read. Still, Mr. Clinton often cannot help being himself. And nothing animates him more than offering his views on political strategy, sometimes with surprising company.

In September 2012, when Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, spoke at the annual Clinton Global Initiative gathering in New York, Mr. Clinton gave him advice backstage about how to appear in command when facing off against Mr. Obama in their coming debates.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/30wuga/to_avert_repeat_of_2008_clinton_team_hopes_to/,nytimes.com
99,"Four months after Rolling Stone magazine published a shocking—and soon discredited—account of a fraternity gang rape at the University of Virginia, the Charlottesville police department has released the results of its investigation into the alleged assault. It comes as no surprise that “no substantive basis” was found for the claim by a student known as “Jackie” that she was raped by seven men at a fraternity party as a UVA freshman in September 2012. What’s striking is to what lengths both the police and many in the news media have gone to tiptoe around the obvious fact that the tale was a hoax by a serial liar. This dance of denial suggests that in the current ideological climate, it is nearly impossible to declare any allegation of rape to be definitely false.

At the press conference, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo stressed that the department’s conclusion “doesn’t mean something terrible didn’t happen to Jackie” and that the investigation is not closed but only suspended until new evidence emerges.

It is, of course, nearly impossible to prove a negative. Short of a surveillance tape documenting Jackie’s every movement, one cannot know for certain that she was never sexually assaulted at UVA. But the evidence against her is damning. It’s not simply that there was no party at Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity named by Jackie, anywhere near the time when she said she was attacked. It’s not simply that her account changed from forced oral sex to vaginal rape and from five assailants to seven, or that her friends saw no sign of her injuries after the alleged assault. What clinches the case is the overwhelming proof that “Drew,” Jackie’s date who supposedly orchestrated her rape, was Jackie’s own invention.

Back in the fall of 2012, Jackie’s friends knew “Drew” as “Haven Monahan,” an upperclassman who supposedly wanted to date her and with whom she encouraged them to exchange emails and text messages. However, an investigation by The Washington Post and other media last December found that “Haven’s” messages were fake; the phone numbers he used were registered to online services that allow texting via the Internet and redirecting calls, while his photo matches a former high school classmate of Jackie’s who lives in a different state. No “Haven Monahan” exists on the UVA campus or, apparently, anywhere in the United States (at least outside romance novels). The catfishing scheme seems to have been a ploy to get the attention of a male friend on whom Jackie had a crush—the same friend she called for help after the alleged assault.

Is it possible that someone sexually assaulted Jackie on the night when she claimed to be going out with her fictional suitor? Theoretically, yes. But it’s also clear that her credibility is as non-existent as “Haven Monahan.”

Moreover, the police investigation has debunked another one of Jackie’s claims: that in spring 2014, when she was already an anti-rape activist, some men harassed her in the street off-campus and threw a bottle that hit her face and (improbably) broke. Jackie said that her roommate picked glass out of a cut on her face; but the roommate disputes this and describes the injury as a scrape, likely from a fall. Jackie also said she called her mother immediately after that attack, but phone records show no such call.

Despite all this, Chief Longo wouldn’t call Jackie’s story a false allegation and even referred to her as “this survivor” (though amending it to the more neutral “or this complaining party”).

Meanwhile, in the CNN report on the March 23 press conference, anchor Brooke Baldwin, correspondent Sara Ganim and legal analyst Sunny Hostin were tripping over each other to assert that “we have to be very careful” not to brand Jackie a liar and that “she could have been sexually assaulted.” Hostin argued that the idea that Jackie made it all up “flies in the face of statistics,” because “only about 2 percent of rapes that are reported are false.”

This is a bogus statistic, which Hostin misattributed to the FBI. (According to FBI data, 8 to 9 percent of police reports of sexual assault are dismissed as “unfounded”; the reality of false rape reports is far more complicated, and it’s almost impossible to get a reliable estimate.) Even if it were true, it would say nothing about Jackie’s specific case. What’s more, statistics on false allegations generally refer to police reports or at least formal administrative complaints at a college—neither of which Jackie was willing to file.

CNN never mentioned the evidence that Jackie fabricated “Haven Monahan.” Neither did the New York Times, which said only that “the police were unable to track Mr. Monahan down.”

Jackie’s defenders argue that rape victims often change their stories because their recall is affected by trauma. It is true that memory, not just of traumatic events, can be unreliable; a victim may at various points give somewhat different descriptions of the offender or the attack. It is also true that, as writer Jessica Valenti argues, someone who tells the truth about being raped may lie to cover up embarrassing details (such as going to the rapist’s apartment to buy drugs).

None of that, however, requires us to suspend rational judgment and pretend that Jackie’s story is anything other than a fabrication. While Jackie is probably more troubled than malevolent, she is not the victim here. If there’s a victim, it’s Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity branded a nest of rapists, suspended and targeted for vandalism—as well as UVA Dean Nicole Eramo, whom the Rolling Stone story painted as a callous bureaucrat indifferent to Jackie’s plight.

In this case, at least, there were no specific accused men. But the extreme reluctance to close a rape investigation and call a lie a lie bodes ill for wrongly accused individuals, who may find themselves under a cloud of suspicion even after all the facts exonerate them.

Evading the facts does a disservice to Jackie, too. In a sane environment, she would face disciplinary charges and perhaps mandatory counseling. In a climate where saying that a woman is lying about rape is tantamount to “victim-blaming” and “rape culture”—and where some of Jackie’s fellow students say that even if her story “wasn’t completely true,” it helped bring attention to important issues—she is likely to remain mired in self-destructive false victimhood.

For the rest of us, this episode shows how extreme and irrational “rape culture” dogma has become, and how urgent it is to break its hold on public discourse. The current moral panic may be an overreaction to real problems of failure to support victims of sexual violence. But when truth becomes heresy, the pendulum has swung too far, with disastrous consequences for civil rights and basic justice.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/30v1mo/the_uva_case_and_rapehoax_denial/,realclearpolitics.com
