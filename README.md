# News-Article-Polarity
Scrape and analyze news articles from conservative and liberal subreddits.
 
## Article Scraping
To gather articles from reddit, run article_scraper.py from the article_scraping folder.  This will save a csv file with rows of random articles posted to both liberal and conservative subreddits.  The subreddit where the articles were posted, as well as the link to the article and article source, are included as columns.  Use --help to see usage.   

## Articles Analysis
Follow along the jupyter notebooks for analysis.  Partisan wordclouds, showing words which most identify the conservative or liberal bent of an article are shown below.
